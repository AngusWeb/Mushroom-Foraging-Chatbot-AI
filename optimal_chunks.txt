Chunk 1:
**Chunk 1: Overview of Fungi in the Book**   Fungi covered in this book include various types such as False Morel, White Saddle, and morels. They can be folded or branched with pores or tubes, and can be round to pear-shaped with spines or teeth. The book also discusses puffballs, jelly fungi, polypores, chanterelles, and tooth fungi, among others. It is important to note that there are thousands of fungal species in Britain and Ireland, and this book focuses only on the most common edible and poisonous ones. **Chunk 2: Species Identification**   When collecting mushrooms, one must be aware that many species may not be included in this book. For example, it covers Beefsteak Fungus, Coral Tooth, and various types of agarics, including brittlegills and milkcaps. The book provides a glossary of mushroom fruitbody terms, such as emarginate and decurrent, which are essential for accurate identification. **Chunk 3: Structure of Edible Fungi**   This book aims to help readers identify edible fungi, particularly those that are easily recognizable. It emphasizes that correct identification can be challenging due to the vast number of species. The goal is to enable readers to recognize major groups of edible mushrooms, such as yellow chanterelles and blueing boletes, and to present similar or problematic fungi for comparison. **Chunk 4: Importance of Understanding Fungi**   Understanding fungi is crucial for anyone interested in mushroom hunting. The introductory section covers what fungi to look for, where to find them, and how to collect and prepare them. This foundational knowledge is key to mastering the skill of identification and enhancing the mushroom hunting experience. **Chunk 5: Diversity of Fungi**   The kingdom of Fungi is incredibly diverse, with an estimated 1.5 million species globally. In Britain and Ireland alone, there are more than 15,000 known fungi. However, not all species form large fruitbodies that are easily noticed during mushroom hunts. Many exist as mycelia within soil and organic matter, only becoming visible under certain conditions. **Chunk 6: Life Cycle of Fungi**   The life cycle of a fungus begins with a microscopic spore that germinates to form a hypha. If the hypha finds nutrients, it will grow and branch, creating a mycelium that spreads in search of more nutrients. When conditions are favorable, the mycelium may produce fruitbodies, which are the fleshy structures visible during mushroom hunting. These fruitbodies play a crucial role in the fungus's reproductive process by producing and dispersing spores.

Chunk 2:
### Chunk 1 We all know little fungal mycelia from the moulds on foods that have become too old. Fungi are neither plants nor animals; they belong to their own kingdom, the kingdom of Fungi. They differ from plants by not being able to perform photosynthesis and from animals by being made up of long cell chains called hyphae.  ### Chunk 2 The fungus itself – the fungal individual – consists of a branched network of hyphae that live in a nutrient substrate, for example, in a layer of leaves or in a tree trunk. Decomposing fungi can thrive on every conceivable source of nutrition, from foods to living plants, plant debris, tree trunks, dung, horn and feathers, to exotic substrates like the coating of camera lenses, the emulsion of photographic film, and aviation fuel.  ### Chunk 3 Each substrate requires a fungal specialist that can secrete exactly the right enzymes needed to dissolve it. To a decomposer fungus, a grassy field or the needle cover of a woodland floor may promise an endless source of food. The fungus can grow unobstructed in all directions, and since fungal mycelia naturally form circular patches, the ground will eventually be covered by large fungal circles. ### Chunk 4 As they grow, the fungi use up the available nutrients before expanding outwards. Therefore, while the mycelia may die away in the nutrient-depleted center, the fungi will remain alive and growing at the outer edge of the circles, thus forming fairy rings. Some fairy rings are noticed only when the fruitbodies appear in the autumn, whereas others can be seen from changes in the grassland itself. ### Chunk 5 The growing mycelium can, for example, release excess nutrients so the vegetation is fertilized and appears greener than the surrounding grass. Alternatively, the fungus may parasitize the grass, leaving a decayed, brown ring in the field. Since fungi cannot photosynthesize, they must, like animals, obtain their energy from the sugars generated by plants. ### Chunk 6 This can happen in two different ways: through decomposition or by symbiosis. Among the ecological strategies of fungi, we find some species that break down simple sugars. A mould growing on jam, for example, absorbs sugar molecules into its branched network of hyphae, which provide the fungus with energy. ### Chunk 7 However, it is not just simple sugars that are metabolized by mushrooms. Most decomposer fungi have developed advanced enzyme systems that enable them to cope with very complex organic substances such as the cellulose and lignin found in the cell walls of plants. Thus, fungi are the universal waste disposal system of nature. ### Chunk 8 Without them, dead plants would simply accumulate; through decomposition, the fungi ensure that dead organic matter is recycled. At the surface, you only see the small fruitbodies, but beneath, a large mycelium spreads through the layer of branches and conifer needles. ### Chunk 9 Some wood decomposers do not just attack the wood of weakened or dead trees; they also attack living trees and kill them. In that way, they are able to prepare their own food and stay ahead of competing species. Parasites like Root Rot (Heterobasidion) cost the forestry industry millions annually. ### Chunk 10 The edible Honey Fungus (Armillaria) also ranks high on the list of expensive forest pests. Decomposition of wood is a particularly challenging job. Wood contains large amounts of cellulose and lignin, and breaking it down requires an advanced enzyme system. ### Chunk 11 Several good edible fungi live as wood decomposers, such as Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa), Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus), and Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa). However, there are also a number of highly destructive fungi among the wood degraders. ### Chunk 12 Jelly spots (Dacrymyces), maze gills (Gloeophyllum), Wet Rot (Coniophora puteana), and Dry Rot (Serpula lacrymans) do damage by decomposing damp wood in houses. Large quantities of dead wood should be left in woodland for fungi to thrive. ### Chunk 13 Some fungi can form mycorrhizal associations only with certain trees, while others, such as many of the amanitas, grow with several different tree species. Since a single tree usually has many different fungal partners, the mycorrhiza will connect both trees and fungi in a complex network. ### Chunk 14 Nutrients can migrate freely through this network, so that sugars can flow from large trees to smaller ones, and even between different species of trees and fungi. In return, the fungus receives sugars from photosynthesis in the plant. ### Chunk 15 The type that involves edible fungi such as boletes (Boletus and others), brittle-gills (Russula), milkcaps (Lactarius), and chanterelles (Cantharellus) is called ectomycorrhiza. Here, the plant partner is almost always a tree. ### Chunk 16 A mycorrhizal association is also a coexistence between a fungus and a plant, but the two partners still appear as separate organisms. In a mycorrhizal symbiosis, fungal mycelia grow around and into plant roots. ### Chunk 17 In this way, the plants are able to extend their root system through the extremely thin fungal hyphae, forming a much finer network than that of the plant roots alone. The very large surface of the mycelium is highly efficient at absorbing water and nutrients, which are then transported back to the plants. ### Chunk 18 Many fungi are involved in symbiosis with photosynthesizing plants. This allows the fungi to have direct access to sugars produced in the plants by photosynthesis. Fungus–plant symbiosis can be divided into two types: lichen formation and mycorrhizal. ### Chunk 19 In lichens, the fungi form flat or branched structures that house single-celled green algae. The algae produce sugars for the fungi, the fungi provide protection for the algae, and both symbionts thrive.

Chunk 3:
**Chunk 1: Introduction to Fungal Integration and Ectomycorrhiza** They are completely integrated into a complex network where minerals and nutrients can flow between all parties involved. Ectomycorrhiza connect a spruce and a beech, with mycelium radiating into the surrounding soil. This small root system may include various mycorrhizal fungi, such as yellowish, reddish, and greenish species. **Chunk 2: Fungal Flora of Ancient Grassland** The fungal flora of ancient grassland can be very diverse, featuring many species of beautiful waxcaps (Hygrocybe and others), club fungi (Clavaria and others), and pinkgills (Entoloma). Unfortunately, these areas do not host many edible mushrooms. A single application of artificial fertilizer can destroy the entire grassland flora and fungi, leading to an invasion of sorrels, nettles, thistles, and cock’s-foot, along with species of Agaricus. **Chunk 3: Characteristics of the Open Landscape** The open landscape mainly consists of fields and meadows, with most fields heavily fertilized through artificial or organic means. Rainfall may also contain nitrogen from slurry. Edible mushrooms in this landscape are typically found in grazed fields, including blewits (Lepista), funnels (Clitocybe and Aspropaxillus), parasols (Macrolepiota and Chlorophyllum), Agaricus species, and puffballs (Lycoperdon and Calvatia). These may form impressive fairy rings visible from a distance. **Chunk 4: Grazed Grassland and Mushroom Hunting** On steep slopes that are difficult to plough, grassland grazed extensively by cattle, horses, or sheep often lacks artificial fertilizer. The vegetation is usually short, with many different herbs and grasses. This leads to a rich habitat for various fungi. **Chunk 5: Categories of Mushroom Habitats** When seeking mushrooms, it is helpful to categorize nature into four main areas: the open landscape, parks, churchyards and cemeteries, coniferous forests, and deciduous woodlands. Before venturing out, it’s important to be aware of access rules in different regions, such as Scotland's Right to Roam and England and Wales's open access rights. **Chunk 6: Mushroom Hunting in Parks and Urban Areas** For urban dwellers, parks, churchyards, and cemeteries are prime locations for mushroom hunting. These areas typically feature extensive lawns with decomposer fungi and trees like oak, beech, birch, lime, and conifers, which host mycorrhizal species. Mushroom collection is often tolerated in public spaces, but seeking permission from landowners is advisable. **Chunk 7: Edible and Poisonous Fungi in Urban Areas** In parklands, various edible mushrooms can be found, including Agaricus species and the slightly poisonous Yellow Stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus). The Fairy Ring Champignon (Marasmius oreades) can form fairy rings in grassy areas. Mycorrhizal fungi such as boletes, milkcaps (Lactarius), brittlegills (Russula), and amanitas are also common. **Chunk 8: Fungi in Coniferous Forests** Conifer plantations may offer numerous edible decomposing fungi during late autumn. The roots and stumps can host large amounts of Dark Honey Fungus (Armillaria ostoyae), while the needle layer may feature fairy rings of Wood Blewit (Lepista nuda). Delicious Agaricus species are also common, but caution is needed due to the presence of the deadly Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa). **Chunk 9: Mycorrhizal Associations in Coniferous Forests** All common conifers (spruce, fir, pine, and larch) form ectomycorrhizal associations, providing habitats for both mycorrhizal and decomposing fungi. Mycorrhizal species include various chanterelles (Cantharellus), Crab and Hintapink Brittlegills (Russula xerampelina and Russula paludosa), and orange-milked milkcaps (Lactarius deterrimus). In Scandinavia, one can also hunt for Forest Lamb (Albatrellus ovinus) and The Gypsy (Cortinarius caperatus).

Chunk 4:
**Chunk 1: Common Edible Mushrooms** One of our very best edible mushrooms, the Common Chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius), can be found in pine plantations as early as July. In contrast, Cep (Boletus edulis) can be found in large quantities during the ‘Cep boom’, for a few weeks around the 1st September. **Chunk 2: Fungal Habitats in Coniferous Forests** Fungal habitats thrive in coniferous forests. The edge of a path through such a forest is a good spot to look for milkcaps or chanterelles. Spruce plantations with a mat of brown needle cover are ideal for finding Cep and Wood Blewit.  **Chunk 3: Ectomycorrhizal Fungi** To hunt for ectomycorrhizal fungi, look for trees like beech, oak, hornbeam, lime, hazel, willow, poplar, and birch. However, ash and maple do not form ectomycorrhizal associations. Among the common edible wood-inhabiting fungi are species of Honey Fungus. **Chunk 4: Edible Ectomycorrhizal Fungi** In microhabitats with differing nutritional conditions and pH levels, you can find delicious edible species like boletes, brittlegills (Russula), hedgehog fungi (Hydnum), chanterelles (Cantharellus), and Horn of Plenty (Craterellus cornucopioides). Beware of the deadly poisonous Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) and Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa) that may grow in the same areas. **Chunk 5: Seasonal Edible Fungi** During summer and autumn, look for Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus) and Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) on old oaks. You may also find the Fungus (Armillaria), which primarily fruits from roots and stumps in mid-autumn. Later in the year, search for Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) on larger trunks, such as beech. **Chunk 6: Deciduous Woodlands** Deciduous woodlands are excellent for discovering edible fungi, both mycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting. Fungi can occur anywhere in a woodland, but the best chances are along roadsides and tracks or on slopes where mixed soil types create diverse fungal habitats. **Chunk 7: Edible Fungi in Winter** Edible fungi can be found throughout autumn until frost destroys the fruit bodies. In winter, only a few cold-adapted species such as Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), Velvet Shank (Flammulina velutipes), and Jelly Ear (Auricularia auricula-judae) remain. Most edible fungi form fruit bodies only when their environment is moist. **Chunk 8: Fungal Growth Patterns** There is often a dry period with few visible fungi during summer, but about four weeks after the first autumn rains, fruit bodies appear—first decomposers, followed by mycorrhizals. During prolonged drought, polypores can be found on large trunks, as rotten wood retains moisture. **Chunk 9: Year-Round Edible Fungi** Edible fungi can be found almost all year round, but most species fruit during autumn. Spring offers rare morels (Morchella) and the more common St George’s Mushroom (Calocybe gambosa). Early summer brings the first chanterelles (Cantharellus), brittlegills (Russula), and boletes. **Chunk 10: Edible Fungi Calendar** A chart outlines when to find various edible fungi throughout the year, indicating which species are available in each month, such as Black Morel, Common Morel, St George’s Mushroom, and many others. **Chunk 11: Nutritional Value of Fungi** Fungi are closely related to animals rather than plants, making it unsurprising that some amino acids hard to obtain from plant diets can be sourced from fungi. Additionally, Vitamin B12, usually found in animal products, is present in some fungi, providing a useful supplement to a vegetarian diet. **Chunk 12: Cultural Significance of Fungi** Traditionally, fungi have been a small component of typical Western European and North American diets. In contrast, Eastern Europe values wild mushrooms, while in Africa, they are an important source of trade and nutrition. In Asia, wild mushrooms are widely used, and cultivation for food and traditional medicine has a long history. **Chunk 13: Medicinal Properties of Fungi** Recent research has focused on the medicinal properties of fungi, particularly their potential in producing antibiotics and other health benefits.

Chunk 5:
### Text Segments for Question-Answer Pairs --- **Segment 1: Introduction to Edible Fungi** Penicillin comes from micro-fungi, which has led to significant interest in this area.

Poisonous effects can vary, with neurotoxins causing symptoms like dizziness and confusion soon after ingestion, while cytotoxins may take hours or days to show effects. **Question:** What are the effects of consuming poisonous mushrooms? **Answer:** Poisonous mushrooms can cause various effects; neurotoxins may lead to dizziness and confusion shortly after ingestion, while cytotoxins can take hours or days to show effects. --- **Segment 8: Categories of Fungal Toxins** Fungal toxins can be divided into four categories: gastrointestinal irritants, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, and other toxins. Gastrointestinal irritants usually cause discomfort soon after consumption. **Question:** How are fungal toxins categorized? **Answer:** Fungal toxins are categorized into gastrointestinal irritants, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, and other toxins. --- **Segment 9: Common Superstitions About Mushrooms** Folk wisdom includes many false beliefs about identifying edible fungi, such as mushrooms being edible if they look or smell good, or if animals eat them. These methods are unreliable. **Question:** What are some common superstitions regarding the identification of edible fungi? **Answer:** Common superstitions include the belief that mushrooms are edible if they look or smell good, or if animals eat them, which are all unreliable methods. --- **Segment 10: Dangerous Poisonous Fungi** A book on edible fungi should also include information on poisonous species that can be confused with edible ones. Notable deadly species include False Morel, Deathcap, and Destroying Angel. **Question:** What are some examples of deadly poisonous fungi that can be confused with edible ones? **Answer:** Examples include False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta), Deathcap (Amanita phalloides), and Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa). --- **Segment 11: Conclusion on Poisonous Mushrooms** The text concludes that while it is safe to touch poisonous mushrooms, caution is still necessary when consuming them, as some can be deadly. **Question:** Is it safe to touch poisonous mushrooms, and what caution should be taken? **Answer:** It is safe to touch poisonous mushrooms, but caution is necessary when consuming them, as some can be deadly.

Chunk 6:
### Text Segments for Question-Answer Pairs --- **Segment 1: The Red Fly Agaric and Legal Protections** The red Fly Agaric is not as poisonous as its reputation suggests – you become sick, but healthy people will not die from eating it. It is protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) against picking and ‘uprooting’. To take specimens, intentionally damage or destroy, or trade specimens of any of these would render the picker liable to a hefty fine. Four species are currently listed, none of which is covered in this book. **Potential Questions:** 1. What is the toxicity level of the red Fly Agaric? 2. What legal protections are in place for the red Fly Agaric? --- **Segment 2: Laws Regarding Mushroom Hunting** While mushroom hunting is normally accepted, it is in fact illegal to ‘uproot’ any ‘wild plant’ without the landowner’s permission. For purposes of the law, plants include fungi, and uprooting is defined as ‘dig up or otherwise remove the plant from the land on which it is growing’, whether or not it actually has roots! Non-commercial collecting is generally tolerated, and the 1968 Theft Act specifically excludes the non-commercial picking of mushrooms from the definition of ‘stealing’. **Potential Questions:** 1. Is it legal to uproot wild mushrooms without permission? 2. What does the 1968 Theft Act say about non-commercial mushroom picking? --- **Segment 3: The Ecological Role of Fungi** Fungi play a key role in every terrestrial ecosystem, decaying and recycling the nutrients from dead organic matter, servicing plants with mycorrhizal and lichen connections, and feeding a host of animals, especially invertebrates. It is therefore the responsibility of all who collect fungi for whatever purpose, whether for eating or identification, to do so in a sustainable manner. **Potential Questions:** 1. What ecological roles do fungi serve in terrestrial ecosystems? 2. Why is it important to collect fungi sustainably? --- **Segment 4: Responsible Foraging Practices** Foragers must know their fungi to avoid picking, removing, and potentially damaging unpalatable and threatened species. Please take only those specimens you know to be at a suitable stage for consumption: leave overmature ones for the beetles, fungus gnats, and other insect larvae to eat. Additionally, try to avoid damaging nature by excessive trampling on sensitive wildlife habitats. **Potential Questions:** 1. What should foragers consider when collecting fungi? 2. Why is it important to leave overmature fungi in the wild? --- **Segment 5: Conservation and Legal Guidelines**

Chunk 7:
Particular restraint should apply to any of the 400 scarcer species on the British national Red Data list or in the UK biodiversity action plans. Among the recommendations of the BMS Code of Conduct for Responsible Collecting of Fungi is that foraging should be actively discouraged on land designated for its wildlife conservation interest. **Potential Questions:** 1. What is the British national Red Data list? 2. What recommendations does the BMS Code of Conduct provide regarding foraging? --- **Segment 6: Quality and Inspection of Fungi** Only young, firm, and healthy fruitbodies are suitable for cooking. Unfortunately, many species are attacked by insect larvae. There is actually a whole group of flies, the fungus gnats, whose larvae survive by eating fungal fruitbodies. Therefore, start by cutting a fruitbody to see what is going on inside. **Potential Questions:** 1. What characteristics should be considered when selecting fungi for cooking? 2. What pests commonly affect edible fungi? --- **Segment 7: Collecting Techniques and Equipment** Before you go mushroom hunting, you need some equipment. First and foremost, the fruitbodies must be picked and cleaned, so you need a knife. It can be a small kitchen knife or a good pocket knife. You can also get special mushroom knives with a small brush that can be used to remove dirt. **Potential Questions:** 1. What equipment is essential for mushroom hunting? 2. Why is a special mushroom knife beneficial for collectors? --- **Segment 8: Cleaning and Preparing Fungi** Before you can start cooking, the mushrooms must be cleaned. The best way to clean mushrooms is to remove as much dirt as possible with a small knife or a brush and then wash with a little water where necessary. Finish by cutting the mushrooms into smaller pieces ready for cooking. **Potential Questions:** 1. What is the best method for cleaning mushrooms before cooking? 2. Why should water be used sparingly when cleaning certain types of fungi? --- **Segment 9: Picking Techniques for Mushrooms** You can pick the mushrooms with or without the basal part and soil. If you do not know which fungus you have found, it is important to bring the whole fruitbody home. Studies have shown that the way the fruitbodies are harvested does not significantly affect the mycelium. **Potential Questions:** 1. What are the different techniques for picking mushrooms? 2. How does the method of harvesting affect the fungus? --- **Segment 10: Culinary Uses of Fungi** Giant Parasol and Giant Puffball must be breaded to be worth the effort. Finally, there is the Beefsteak Fungus, which is soft and very sour, but is an unusual aesthetic experience when used raw in sushi. Many species can provide excellent food, but a little more cooking is often required to get a good result. **Potential Questions:** 1. What are some culinary uses for different types of fungi? 2. Why is the Beefsteak Fungus considered an unusual ingredient?  ---  These segments are structured to facilitate the creation of meaningful question-answer pairs while maintaining coherence and focus on the subject matter.

Chunk 8:
### Chunk 1 Species that do not taste of much are most fun if you can mix them with the more flavourful species. This is true of all the species that are only awarded one green dot in this book. Some species are outside these categories: blewits, for example, have a perfumed taste which some people like and others hate; Jelly Ear is strangely cartilaginous, but can be baked into pâtés and pies; Garlic Parachute may be used as an onion substitute. They are easy to cook and have a characteristic taste of more than just ‘mushroom’. ### Chunk 2 Morels, chanterelles, Horn of Plenty, hedgehog fungi, Hen of the Woods, and the good boletes and milkcaps all have their own cooking mushrooms. A pan full of freshly collected chanterelles (Cantharellus) should consider a combination of taste and consistency after cooking. The species in the category ‘good taste, firm consistency’ are among the best edible mushrooms. ### Chunk 3 There are thousands of mushroom species out there, but which ones are worth picking and how can they be cooked? In an attempt to rank the book’s edible mushrooms, you may consider the Orange Birch Bolete (Leccinum versipelle) as a much-needed dietary supplement on a mountain hike with freeze-dried food. ### Chunk 4 Good taste, firm consistency mushrooms include morels, Wood Cauliflower, Hen of the Woods, Forest Lamb, red-tubed boletes, chanterelles, Horn of Plenty, hedgehog fungi, Crab Brittlegill, and Saffron Milkcap. Good taste, soft consistency mushrooms include Cep, St George’s Mushroom, honey fungi, and marzipan-smelling Agaricus spp.  ### Chunk 5 Mild taste, firm consistency mushrooms include many brittlegills, Chicken of the Woods, and Giant Polypore. Mild taste, soft consistency mushrooms include many boletes, Oyster Mushroom, reddening Agaricus species, and Shaggy Inkcap. ### Chunk 6 A good soup is another simple mushroom dish: fry some mushrooms and chopped onions in a pot. Then add water and stock and bring it to the boil. Add cream, balance with lemon and salt, and you have the nicest mushroom soup. If the mushrooms are a bit old or have a poor consistency, the soup can be blended. ### Chunk 7 Many species are suitable for soup, and if you have fungi smeared in sand, soup is the obvious choice, as the sand ends up at the bottom. I especially like a soup made from the yellowing, marzipan-scented Agaricus species. ### Chunk 8 As a rule, you must be careful not to overfill the pan, and you must fry them hard and relentlessly to make them crisp. It is much easier to fry very young boletes, as even by ‘middle age’ they become problematic. Older specimens are worthless. ### Chunk 9 An interesting variation is to slice young Ceps very thin and fast-fry them in plenty of very hot oil. In this way, the fungi hardly shrink and they keep some of their nut-like raw taste. A variation is to stir plenty of cooked fungi with boiled pasta. ### Chunk 10 All generations of my family love, for example, Wood Cauliflower, Hen of the Woods, or Chicken of the Woods prepared in this way. When the pan becomes dry, add some olive oil (or butter) and continue frying until the pieces turn brown at the edges. Finally, add some cream and season with lemon and salt. ### Chunk 11 The dish can be varied by frying the mushrooms with finely chopped onions or similar, but be careful not to mix with too many other flavours as they can easily overwhelm the mushroom taste. Some species, e.g., Hen of the Woods, contain very little liquid, so with these, you may use oil or butter from the start. ### Chunk 12 Most fungi have to lose up to 80% of their weight in water before they can fry. Boletes are especially tricky to get right because they easily become slimy. There are as many opinions about edible mushrooms and mushroom preparation as there are chefs. ### Chunk 13 The mother of all mushroom recipes is fried and stewed mushrooms. When you want to taste a new edible species, you should use this method so that you get the best impression of the basic taste of that particular fungus. Frying fungi is easy: cut the cleaned mushrooms into centimetre-sized pieces and toss them in a hot pan. ### Chunk 14 As a rule, they will start to release a lot of water, which should be allowed to boil away. Young Beefsteak Fungus has a very flesh-like inner structure. If you cut it thinly, it can become a very exotic element in sushi. ### Chunk 15 Two of the species included in this book – Giant Puffball and Giant Parasol – should be coated in breadcrumbs before being cooked. Take hard fruitbodies of Giant Puffball, typically 10–20 cm in diameter, and cut them into centimetre-thick slices. ### Chunk 16 With Giant Parasol, use the 15–25 cm-wide flat caps without the stem. Coat the mushroom in beaten egg and white breadcrumbs, season with salt and pepper, and fry the whole thing in the pan until it turns golden brown. ### Chunk 17 Because many fungi are indigestible or even poisonous before cooking, only a few species are recommended to be eaten raw. These include boletes of the cep group (but no other boletes), some species of Agaricus, and others that can be used raw together with, for example, onions, garlic, red pepper, and cheese. ### Chunk 18 Mushrooms can also be used in pies or as pizza topping. Species that tend to soften during cooking work well in pies. Make some pastry by mixing 100 ml of water and 100 ml of olive oil with 300 g of wheat flour. ### Chunk 19 Let it rest for a while in the fridge, then roll it thinly and line a couple of pie dishes. Pre-bake the bases at 200 °C until they are light brown. Fry the mushrooms until they have released their water and place them in the pie. ### Chunk 20 Chop a few onions and cloves of garlic, and sprinkle them over the mushrooms. Stir four eggs together with some milk and pour over the filling. Bake at 200 °C until the surface is golden brown. ### Chunk 21 Frozen mushrooms are another way of preserving mushrooms. Some species, e.g., Cep, are suitable for raw freezing: the mushrooms are cleaned, cut into cubes, and frozen in freezer bags. In other species, it is an advantage to pre-fry the mushrooms before they are bagged. ### Chunk 22 Fry until the water is boiled away, but delay the final browning until you prepare the dish. When pre-fried, you gain a lot of space in the freezer, as the mushrooms shrink to well below half the volume. ### Chunk 23 Salting mushrooms is a method of preservation that is used especially in Eastern Europe.

Chunk 9:
### Chunk 1: Salting Bearded Milkcaps An advantage of salting is that it can also remove the hot taste from bearded milkcaps. In Eastern Europe, these are therefore prized edible mushrooms. Clean the milkcaps and soak them for a few minutes in boiling water. Drain and let them cool. Then put the mushrooms between layers of coarse salt in a washed and scalded jar. Press the pieces down with something heavy, such as a stone in a clean plastic bag. The salt will quickly extract the water so that the fungi are covered in brine. After a few weeks, the mushrooms are ready, but they need to be desalinated for a few hours in cold water before they can be used. ### Chunk 2: Drying Mushrooms Believe it or not, one day you may manage to find so many good edible mushrooms that you simply can’t eat them all. An easy way to store mushrooms is to dry them. This can be done by simply spreading a thin layer of mushrooms on a table on a sunny day, or by spreading them on a wire mesh on a radiator. The most effective method, however, is to use a food dehydrator, where the mushrooms are put in narrow trays that can be stacked in many layers above a heat source. ### Chunk 3: Preparing Mushrooms for Drying In order to dry efficiently, it is important that the fruit bodies are not thick and fleshy. Thin-fleshed mushrooms, such as Horn of Plenty and Trumpet Chanterelles, can be placed directly in the dryer, while the more solid ones must be cut into slices to let the water evaporate. When the dried mushrooms are put into jars and sealed properly, they will last for years. When the need arises, soak the dried fungi in water for an hour before cooking. ### Chunk 4: Fungi in Medicine Fungi have healing properties. Wild edible fungi, such as Hen of the Woods, have long been used in Asian medicine, typically to strengthen the immune system. Since World War II, fungi have also played a huge role in the West. Moulds, for example, of the genus Penicillium, are mainly responsible for producing antibiotics. Due to these, people are much less likely to die from common infections such as pneumonia or blood poisoning. ### Chunk 5: Genetic Engineering of Fungi As with enzyme production, the genetic code for an antibiotic is genetically engineered into a yeast fungus, which then produces the desired substance in a fermentation tank. The fungi are thus both a source and biofactories. In modern biotechnological production, fungi play a major role as biofactories. Yeast fungi are easy to grow in an oxygen-free environment, and if you engineer the genetic code for a desired protein or enzyme into a yeast fungus, the fungus will excrete the desired substance during its growth. ### Chunk 6: Fungi in Alcohol Production Mushrooms are useful for much more than delicious cookery. They have a role in both hobby projects such as yarn-dyeing and industrially as biofactories in the production of medicines and enzymes. Alcohol is formed by fermentation, and this is where fungi, or more precisely yeasts, are essential. When yeasts grow in an oxygen-free environment, they convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide bubbles away while the alcohol remains in the liquid, which may be transformed into wine, beer, or other beverages. ### Chunk 7: Dyeing Yarn with Fungi The reason why fungi are coloured is a mystery, as the fungi don’t need to attract insects for pollination. Nevertheless, fungi can have very strong colours, including intense reds and blues. Many fungal dyes are unstable and will disappear if you dry or heat the fruit bodies, but some species contain stable dyes that can bind to yarn. For example, the Surprise Webcap produces a splendid orange-red colour, while the Cinnamon Bracket results in rare purple colours. ### Chunk 8: Understanding the Hymenophore The majority of the fungi have spores that form on the underside of the cap. The area where the spore formation takes place is called the hymenophore. Under the cap, it is well-protected from rain and drought so that the spores can be produced and released undisturbed into the wind. Most fungal species have developed folded structures with a larger surface area to produce as many spores as possible per fruit body. ### Chunk 9: Structure of Fungal Fruit Bodies The purpose of fungal fruit bodies is to undertake sexual reproduction and produce sexual spores that help the fungus to disperse. Although fungal fruit bodies can appear fleshy and well-structured, they are formed by tubular fungal hyphae woven together, much like interwoven yarn. The small, very young Ferny Bonnet is magnified to show the hyphae that make up the fruit body. ### Chunk 10: Identifying Fungi by Spore Colour To identify an agaric, it is important to know the colour of its spores. However, spores are too small to see with the naked eye, so to judge the colour, you have to look at a spore deposit.

Chunk 10:
### Chunk 1 If you have a good lens, you can examine the gills or search at the top of the stem where you can often find small spore deposits in wrinkles and remnants of the veil. If the fungi have grown in an overlapping fashion, there may also be spore deposits on top of the lower caps. But if nothing is found, you can make your own spore deposit. ### Chunk 2 The agarics are divided into these spore colours: spore formation. Except for the morels, all of this book’s edible mushrooms belong to the group of fungi called the Basidiomycota. In these, the spores are usually formed in fours at the top of a cell called a basidium. The basidia sit on the hymenophore, for example, on gills, on spines or inside tubes and pores. ### Chunk 3 If you look at the picture below showing a gill at high magnification (20x–40x), you can see the spores sitting in groups of four at the top of the basidia.  ### Chunk 4 To make a spore deposit, take a fresh cap and cut off the stem. Then place the cap with the gills facing downwards on a piece of white paper and cover it with a bowl or a piece of plastic to prevent it from drying. If the fungus is fresh and alive, it will usually release spores onto the paper within 2–4 hours. ### Chunk 5 In this Weeping Widow (Lacrymaria lacrymabunda), the black spore colour is revealed by the thousands of spores trapped in the veil remnants. A close study of the gills shows white (immature) and black (mature) spores sitting in fours at the top of the basidia. ### Chunk 6 Overview of fungal groups in this book: chanterelles, tooth fungi, boletes, polypores, brittlegills and milkcaps, agarics.  ### Chunk 7 Semifree Morel (Morchella semilibera) is a small, thin-fleshed and very slender morel. The margin around the lower part of the head is free of the stem, hence the name. It otherwise looks like a small Common Morel and is likewise a good edible mushroom, but you have to find quite a lot of fruitbodies for one dish. It must not be eaten raw. ### Chunk 8 Semifree Morel is found mostly in places affected by human activity, for example, where disturbance and earthworks have brought limy deposits to the surface. It fruits in April and May, at the same time as other species of Morel. ### Chunk 9 Common Morel (Morchella esculenta) is the culinary best of the morels. It is a very distinctive edible mushroom with a characteristic, powerful taste (enhanced by a few drops of lemon). Not to be eaten raw. The Common Morel is immensely variable in shape and colour and can also grow in very different habitats. ### Chunk 10 Typically forming fruitbodies during April and May, Common Morel is found mostly on soils with a high pH. Naturally alkaline soils on chalk or limestone can yield a stable harvest year after year. It can also be found around deposits of mortar and cement, although occurrences in such spots are likely to be sporadic. ### Chunk 11 Common Morel lives in a mycorrhiza-like symbiosis with trees, perhaps especially elms. Morels are spring fungi that form large, almost club-shaped fruitbodies with a ‘head’ that has a honeycomb-like exterior. The whole fruitbody is hollow. ### Chunk 12 False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is only distantly related to the true morels but looks a lot like them. The main difference is that the head of the False Morel does not have a large internal cavity, but is instead folded in a brain-like manner. Although deadly poisonous when raw, most of the toxins in False Morel are removed by drying or cooking. ### Chunk 13 However, there are still some residues left, and it is therefore not advisable to experiment with eating species of Gyromitra. False Morel forms a mycorrhizal association with pine on poor, gravelly or sandy soil. The fruitbodies are found from late March to May. ### Chunk 14 White Saddle (Helvella crispa) is another distant relative of the morels. It has a pitted or furrowed stem bearing a folded or saddle-shaped head. All parts are whitish. White Saddle grows in humid hardwood forest soils, especially along the sides of roads and tracks, where it fruits during autumn. ### Chunk 15 It is not poisonous, but not worth eating. There are many other species of Saddle, such as the Elfin Saddle (Helvella lacunosa), which looks like a completely grey version of the White Saddle. ### Chunk 16 Black Morel (Morchella elata) is less fleshy than the Common Morel. It has an elongated, pointed top, where the pattern is dominated by longitudinal ribs. Unlike the Common Morel, Black Morel is a decomposer. ### Chunk 17 One of the places where you can sometimes find it in large amounts is in beds of wood chips under, for example, roses or rhododendrons in parks and public gardens. In such places you can’t count on a stable supply of morels year after year, but when you do find them, there may be hundreds of fruitbodies. ### Chunk 18 Since the fruitbodies can be very large and keep fresh for a long time in the fridge, one fruitbody can be enough for many meals. The taste is fine and the texture crisp, but avoid old, brownish specimens as these may have a bitter taste.  ### Chunk 19 Try making a stew with cream and a little lemon, and mix it with pasta before serving. Wood Cauliflower is found scattered in conifer plantations with spruce or pine. It usually forms fruitbodies at the base of the trees, often in the gap between two roots and can be found throughout autumn. ### Chunk 20 Upright Coral (Ramaria stricta) forms medium-sized, orange to light brown, branched fruitbodies that grow from twigs and branches of beech.

Chunk 11:
### Chunk 1 Unlike Wood Cauliflower, the branches of Upright Coral are largely round in cross-section and the branching is upright. Although it can be one of the most common fungi in an autumn beech wood, Upright Coral is of no value as an edible fungus. There are many other species of coral fungi, some of which are edible. However, they look very much alike and should be avoided. ### Chunk 2 Coral Tooth (Hericium coralloides) forms coral-like branched fruitbodies in which the white branches are clad with long, downward-pointing spines. It grows on old beeches and is mostly seen quite late in autumn. Coral Tooth can be eaten, but since it is rare and registered as Near Threatened on the British Red Data list, you should leave it to beautify the woodland scene. ### Chunk 3 Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa) grows on conifers. The fruitbodies can be as large as a football and consist of curly, flat, beige-coloured lobes. The flesh often has a slight chemical odour that disappears during cooking. Other similar fungi include Upright Coral, which can have the same colour as Wood Cauliflower but grows on hardwood, and Coral Tooth, which forms large, branched, white fruitbodies lined with white, downward-pointing spines. ### Chunk 4 Dryad’s Saddle (Cerioporus squamosus) forms very large, rather soft-fleshed fruitbodies, which are attached to the tree with a short, dark stem. The upper side has coarse scales and the pores are several millimetres wide. Other similar fungi include Tuberous Polypore (Polyporus tuberaster), which is smaller and also edible. Dryad’s Saddle is common on old deciduous trees, especially in parks and gardens. ### Chunk 5 Dryad’s Saddle forms fruitbodies mostly during May and June but may also be found later in the year. Young specimens are edible and smell a bit like cucumber or watermelon. However, the stem and mature fruitbodies are tough and cannot be used. Dryad’s Saddle has recently entered the menus of gourmet restaurants as part of the wave of New Nordic Cuisine. ### Chunk 6 Polypores form fruitbodies where the underside is covered in small holes (pores). The pore lining produces the spores, which disperse in the air when they drop out of the mouth of the pore. They mostly grow on wood. Other similar fungi include boletes, which also have holes below the cap, but consist of single tubes that can usually be separated from each other and from the flesh of the cap. ### Chunk 7 Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus) tastes mild and has a very firm consistency that is quite reminiscent of chicken meat. Some say that specimens that have grown on oak taste more sour than those that have grown on other deciduous trees. Various species of Chicken of the Woods are very popular edible fungi around the world. ### Chunk 8 Young Chicken of the Woods, where the pores are not yet properly developed, are edible after thorough cooking. They should be cut into thin slices or small cubes and fried in a pan. It is important to ensure that the pieces are heated all the way through, as raw or poorly cooked Chicken of the Woods may cause an upset stomach. ### Chunk 9 Umbrella Polypore (Cladomeris umbellatus) resembles Hen of the Woods but has small caps attached by a central stem. It grows on the ground near old beeches and is also occasionally found by oaks. While Umbrella Polypore is edible, it is less tasty and much softer than Hen of the Woods, and is often attacked by insect larvae. ### Chunk 10 Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) forms large, tiered fruitbodies with many small caps. Each brown-grey cap looks like a small tongue, attached by a stalk to the rest of the fruitbody. The pore surface is white and the pores are quite large. Hen of the Woods grows on old oaks and typically emerges in a gap between two roots during autumn. ### Chunk 11 There have been heated discussions about the edibility of the Giant Polypore (Meripilus giganteus). It is not poisonous, but its somewhat sour, slightly perfumed taste is not what most mushroom hunters expect from a good edible fungus. However, young fruitbodies are considered acceptable by some, and they darken during cooking. ### Chunk 12 Giant Polypore is one of the most striking fungi, forming gigantic, tiered, brown fruitbodies at the base of beech trees. It lacks the bright yellow and orange colours of Chicken of the Woods, and its beige-coloured pore surface becomes darker when touched. Giant Polypore typically appears in August and early September.

Chunk 12:
### Chunk 1 Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) is an edible mushroom that has similar coloration to other fungi but is smaller in size. Unlike some mushrooms, it does not turn dark when touched and typically grows on oak trees. Young specimens of Hen of the Woods can provide a unique culinary experience, and it can be used in various dishes, including salads and pickles. However, one of the most spectacular uses is on Nigiri sushi. ### Chunk 2 Beefsteak Fungus (Fistulina hepatica) is another edible mushroom known for its peculiar, tongue-shaped fruitbodies filled with red juice. When cut, it reveals a juicy, structured flesh that resembles raw tongue. The underside of the fungus is covered with small tubes, which are initially fused together in young specimens but become free and open as they mature. Beefsteak Fungus grows exclusively on old oaks and typically appears in August or September. ### Chunk 3 Fused Polypore (Albatrellus confluens) resembles Forest Lamb but has a browner cap and does not change color when touched. It has a bitter taste and should not be mixed with edible fungi, although it is not considered poisonous. Fused Polypore is widespread in European conifer forests but is not found in Britain and Ireland. ### Chunk 4 Forest Lamb (Albatrellus ovinus) is a polypore that grows on the ground, resembling pale boletes. Its cap is very pale brown, and the pore mouths change color to pale yellow when touched. When cooked, all parts of Forest Lamb turn yellow. This mushroom is extremely rare in Britain and Ireland, but it is an excellent edible fungus found more commonly in Norway, Sweden, and the Alps. Only young specimens should be collected and should be thoroughly cooked. ### Chunk 5 Dryad’s Saddle and similar polypores have a cap and stem, but their flesh is tough, and their pores are inseparable from the flesh of the cap. They mostly grow on wood. In contrast, Forest Lamb has soft flesh and a bolete-like shape, while Beefsteak Fungus is soft-fleshed and filled with reddish juice. Boletes, which form soft-fleshed fruitbodies with caps and stems, are easy to recognize and are suitable for beginners. ### Chunk 6 Boletes contain a lot of water, making it an art to fry them while retaining their structure. It is advisable to pick young, firm fruitbodies rather than older, softer ones. When cooking, place a single layer of mushrooms in the pan, cook over high heat, and let the liquid evaporate before adding oil or butter. For a variation, slice young Ceps thinly and fast-fry them in hot oil to preserve their nut-like raw taste. ### Chunk 7 Boletes can be dried or frozen for later use. To dry them, cut the mushrooms into thin slices, as this helps reduce sliminess during cooking. Freezing is also an option; you can freeze raw mushrooms or cook them first to reduce their water content. The main species in the boletes group is Cep (Boletus edulis), recognizable by its greasy cap surface. It grows in various woodlands and is most common in autumn. ### Chunk 8 Summer Bolete (Boletus reticulatus) is another common species with a paler cap than Cep, found in open landscapes like parks. Bitter Bolete (Tylopilus felleus) resembles Cep but is inedible. It is important to distinguish between these species, as the majority of boletes are edible, while a few are moderately poisonous or have a bitter taste.

Chunk 13:
### Chunk 1 It can be identified by the white tubes that turn pink with age, the dark net ornamentation of the stem, and the very bitter taste. It is not poisonous, but a single fruitbody can taint an entire dish. Bitter Bolete is quite common in August and September and grows with both deciduous and coniferous trees. ### Chunk 2 Boletes with white tube mouths, maturing to yellow, belong to the cep group. They have pale net-like ornamentation down the stem and are all edible and good. Other similar fungi include those in the bolete genus Leccinum, which have long, scaly stems and tubes that remain whitish to greyish. ### Chunk 3 Forest Lamb (Albatrellus ovinus) has white tubes that cannot easily be detached from the cap. This species is rarely found in Britain and Ireland but is more common in Scandinavian coniferous forests. Species of the cep group of boletes form large fruitbodies with a club-shaped stem and a rounded cap, shaped like a bun. ### Chunk 4 They never turn blue when touched or cut. You have to start looking for members of this group from the end of August or the beginning of September; timing varies according to how dry the summer has been. They may fruit in a concentrated period of two to three weeks, known as the cep boom. ### Chunk 5 Ceps can still be found later in the autumn, but are then usually much more scattered. Cep should be collected young. As long as they are shaped like champagne corks, they are among the best edible mushrooms, but as soon as the tubes start to turn yellow, they become soft. ### Chunk 6 If you want to use middle-aged fruitbodies with yellow tubes, remove the tubes before cooking, or the dish will become very sticky. Old fruitbodies should be avoided. Species of the cep group form mycorrhizal associations with many different trees, such as beech, oak, birch, spruce, pine, and fir. ### Chunk 7 If you want to distinguish between the species, you must know the host tree and study the details of the cap cuticle. Fortunately, all species are equally tasty. The Rusty Bolete (Xerocomus ferrugineus) can be recognized by its felted cap (like suede) and the coarse, bright yellow tube mouths, which usually do not become blue when bruised. ### Chunk 8 Often, the tubes continue a little down the stem and form a short, coarse net ornamentation. The stem base usually has bright yellow hyphal strings. This species belongs to a group of very soft-fleshed boletes and should only be used in combination with more tasty and hard-fleshed fungi. ### Chunk 9 There are several very similar relatives with similar culinary characteristics, such as the Suede Bolete (Xerocomus subtomentosus). Most species lack well-defined net ornamentation on the stem. This group has no poisonous members, but several are bitter-tasting and some are soft-fleshed, best suited as a supplement to fungi with a firmer texture. ### Chunk 10 Bay Bolete (Imleria badia) is a medium-sized bolete with a brown, smooth stem and yellow tubes. The cap is at first felted (like suede) but later becomes sticky, especially in warm, humid weather. The tube mouths are small and turn blue a few seconds after bruising. ### Chunk 11 Bay Bolete can grow with both deciduous and coniferous trees, but is most common in spruce forests. It is one of the better edible mushrooms in this group. Young specimens may have almost the consistency of Cep, but not as good a taste. ### Chunk 12 There are two inedible bitter boletes with yellow tubes: Bitter Beech Bolete and Rooting Bolete. Both are large boletes with a net ornamentation on a stem that is more than 2 cm thick. Bitter Beech Bolete (Caloboletus calopus) forms pale-capped fruitbodies with pale yellow tube mouths and a stem with unusually beautiful net ornamentation. ### Chunk 13 At the top, the net is yellow, but towards the base, it changes gradually to red. All parts of the fruitbodies turn blue when wounded, and the flesh tastes very bitter. Bitter Beech Bolete is found scattered on nutrient-poor soil in both deciduous and coniferous woodlands. ### Chunk 14 Rooting Bolete (Caloboletus radicans) forms very large fruitbodies with pale caps and pale yellow colors on the tubes and stem. Its stem has a very fine, yellow net ornamentation that can be difficult to see without a lens. The flesh and tube mouths turn blue when bruised, and it has a bitter taste. ### Chunk 15 Rooting Bolete is found scattered with deciduous trees in warm parks and cemeteries. It fruits mostly in August and the first half of September. There are several very similar but mild-tasting species in the genus Butyriboletus, such as the rare Pale Bolete (Butyriboletus fechtneri) and Oak Bolete (Butyriboletus appendiculatus).  ### Chunk 16 These are all edible. The genus Xerocomellus contains a number of small boletes with stems 1–2 cm thick and yellow tube mouths, and without well-developed net ornamentation. The species of the group are difficult to separate and are only considered moderately good edible mushrooms – best suited as supplementary to other fungi. ### Chunk 17 Red Cracking Bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) forms small, soft-fleshed fruitbodies with a red-dotted stem, pale yellow tube mouths, and a brown, cracking cap. It grows with beech and conifers and is mostly found from August to September. ### Chunk 18 Matt Bolete is very similar, but usually fruits during September and October. It is extremely similar to Red Cracking Bolete, but its cap shows fewer cracks and often has a narrow, red zone along the margin. Young specimens may have a characteristic dew-like cap surface. ### Chunk 19 There are many similar species, all soft-fleshed and of secondary culinary value. The genera Suillellus and Neoboleus contain moderately large boletes with red tube mouths. Stem, flesh, and tubes will change color from yellow to indigo blue within seconds when cut or bruised. ### Chunk 20 All species are edible, but only after cooking; eaten raw, they may cause poisoning, resulting in dizziness and a stomach upset. Other similar fungi include Devil’s Bolete, which has a light grey cap and reacts moderately light blue when cut, and Bilious Bolete, which also has a pale cap with distinct pink hues.

Chunk 14:
### Text Segments for Question-Answer Pairs --- **Segment 1: Scarletina Bolete Description** Scarletina Bolete (Neoboletus erythropus) forms large, firm fruitbodies and is an excellent edible fungus (but only when cooked). It has a brown or yellow-brown cap and is differentiated from similar boletes by the stem surface which does not have net ornamentation, but is instead covered with small, orange-red dots. The species is common in deciduous and coniferous woods on slightly poor soils. It is most frequent in August and September. --- **Segment 2: Devil’s Bolete Characteristics** Devil’s Bolete (Rubroboletus satanas) is a large bolete with a pale grey to beige cap, red tube mouths, and a thick, club-shaped stem. The net ornamentation of the stem is yellow at the top but lower down becomes a very characteristic rose-pink colour. The surface where the tubes adhere to the cap is yellow and the flesh slowly becomes moderately blue when cut. The taste is mild, but the smell is strong, sweet, and rather nauseous, often likened to pig dung. Devil’s Bolete is rare and grows in warm places on rich soils with beech, oak, and lime, typically in parks, gardens, and open woodland in southern Britain and Ireland. --- **Segment 3: Poisoning Risks of Devil’s Bolete** The species is responsible for some very unpleasant poisonings, causing severe vomiting and diarrhoea.  --- **Segment 4: Bilious Bolete Overview** Bilious Bolete (Rubroboletus legaliae) is also a large bolete with orange net ornamentation on the stem. The cap is pale without much brown but usually has obvious pinkish shades, especially near the margin. The surface where the tubes adhere to the cap is yellow. The flesh slowly becomes moderately blue and it lacks the unpleasant odour of Devil’s Bolete. Bilious Bolete is very rare and is found in warm places on clay soils with beech. --- **Segment 5: Lurid Bolete Characteristics** Lurid Bolete (Suillellus luridus) forms large fruitbodies with a light brown cap and a thick stem that has an orange net ornamentation. All parts turn blue very quickly and vigorously. Uniquely, the surface where the yellow tubes are attached to the cap flesh is red. The species is one of our very best edible mushrooms—just never eat it raw, as it may cause dizziness and an upset stomach. Lurid Bolete is rather common on clay soils in warm parks, churchyards, and cemeteries during late summer and early autumn. --- **Segment 6: Identifying Lurid Bolete** To guard against confusion with the Devil’s Bolete and Bilious Bolete, check that your Lurid Bolete has a predominantly brown cap and that the surface where the tube layer is attached to the flesh is red. The two poisonous species lack this red surface. --- **Segment 7: Orange Birch Bolete Description** Orange Birch Bolete (Leccinum versipelle) belongs to the group of orange-capped species whose flesh turns dark grey when cut. It grows with birch and is somewhat rarer than its brown-capped cousin. A very similar species, Orange Bolete (Leccinum aurantiacum), is found scattered with oak and poplar trees. --- **Segment 8: Edibility and Caution with Leccinum Species** Orange Birch Bolete and its allies have rather firm flesh and a better taste than the brown species of Leccinum. Unfortunately, they contain some somewhat toxic substances that cause a stomach upset if eaten raw. After being cooked thoroughly, they are considered to be good edible mushrooms, but still, some people report stomach problems. Therefore, start out with caution. --- **Segment 9: Characteristics of Leccinum Genus** The boletes in the genus Leccinum are recognizable by their long stems covered in fine scales. In most species, the scales are dark and easy to see. All species are considered edible after thorough cooking, although some people get an upset stomach from the orange species. --- **Segment 10: Larch Bolete Overview** Larch Bolete (Suillus grevillei) forms medium-sized fruitbodies with orange-brown caps and a small, slimy ring. It always grows with larch and is one of the most common boletes in gardens. It fruits all autumn. With somewhat softer flesh than Slippery Jack, this species does not rank highly among edible mushrooms. --- **Segment 11: Velvet Bolete Characteristics** Velvet Bolete (Suillus variegatus) is a species of Suillus without a ring. The cap is initially felted when young, becoming scaly and covered with only a very thin layer of slime. The tube mouths have a characteristic greyish-yellow colour. Velvet Bolete is a moderately good edible fungus found with pine trees throughout autumn. --- **Segment 12: Peppery Bolete Description** Peppery Bolete (Chalciporus piperatus) resembles a Suillus but has large, brownish-orange tubes, yellow flesh, and a slightly hot, peppery taste. It is not poisonous but is generally not considered edible due to the taste. It fruits from August to October and is often found in spruce forests. --- **Segment 13: Slippery Jack Overview** Slippery Jack (Suillus luteus) is the best edible species of the genus Suillus. It forms medium-sized fruitbodies with a dark brown, very slimy cap, pale yellow tubes, and a large, slimy ring on the stem. Slippery Jack grows with pine trees and is widely recognized among edible fungi. --- **Segment 14: Characteristics of Slimy Boletes** The slimy boletes in the genus Suillus are, when young, completely wrapped in a slimy universal veil. When mature, the cap expands and the slime remains on the cap surface and at the base of the stem. Some species also retain a slimy ring. All grow with conifers and are edible. ---  These segments can be used to create targeted questions and answers that focus on specific aspects of each fungus, ensuring clarity and relevance.

Chunk 15:
### Chunk 1 It is especially important to collect very young, firm fruitbodies and pull the slime layer from the cap with a knife. Young fruitbodies of Slippery Jack (Suillus) are wrapped in a slimy veil.  ### Chunk 2 There are also more slender, deep brown-orange types within the Wood Hedgehog species complex. These are just as good edible mushrooms as the pale and more fleshy versions. Scaly Tooth (Sarcodon squamosus) and other species of Sarcodon usually are brown and are often very scaly.  ### Chunk 3 They have rather soft flesh and look inviting, but they often have a bitter and unpleasant taste. Within this group, there are several very similar species that are difficult to tell apart; some are rare and should be left to adorn their habitats rather than be collected.  ### Chunk 4 Orange Tooth (Hydnellum aurantiacum) and other species of Hydnellum have brown, orange, or bluish colors and are often rather tough. There are many rare species which are difficult to recognize. None are known to be poisonous, but Devil’s Tooth (Hydnellum peckii) has a very unpleasant bitter taste. ### Chunk 5 Wood Hedgehog (Hydnum repandum) forms rather large, soft-fleshed fruitbodies. The cap color is difficult to describe, but as the pictures show, the margin can be almost white, while the middle is often pinkish-yellow to yellowish-orange.  ### Chunk 6 The flesh and surface often become darker orange-brown when bruised, and it may have a sour or fishy smell. The fruitbodies may even emit almost urine-like odors during frying, but well-done Wood Hedgehog is an excellent edible mushroom. ### Chunk 7 This species forms mycorrhizal associations with deciduous trees and fruits from August to October. Wood Hedgehog is actually a complex of more than ten very similar but poorly understood species, making it difficult to give an exact description of its habitat. ### Chunk 8 Some types are found in beech woods on clays, while others can be very common on poor soils with beech or conifers. Tooth fungi have a stem and a cap, but unlike many mushrooms, the underside of the cap is covered with small teeth or spines. ### Chunk 9 The edible species belong to the genus of hedgehog mushrooms (Hydnum). These are all soft-fleshed, and their caps are whitish, light yellow-orange, or brownish-orange. They form mycorrhiza and grow on the ground in woodlands. ### Chunk 10 There are a number of other genera with teeth or spines underneath that are inedible but not poisonous. If you stick to the soft-fleshed species with whitish, yellow-orange, or brownish-orange colors, you are safe. ### Chunk 11 Other similar groups of fungi include False Chanterelle (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca), which resembles yellow chanterelles but has true gills that are regularly forked. Funnels may be shaped like chanterelles but have whitish true gills, and some species are poisonous. ### Chunk 12 Rollrims (Paxillus) form large, brown fruitbodies with the edge of the cap rolled under and decurrent gills. When bruised, the pale brown gills change to dark brown. Some species of Rollrim are poisonous. ### Chunk 13 Pig’s Ear (Gomphus clavatus) is large and fleshy with a chanterelle shape and branched veins on the underside. When young, it is violet, but with age, it becomes more brownish. It is a good edible fungus but is extremely rare in Britain. ### Chunk 14 Rollrims have a unique poisonous effect; they are initially edible, but repeated consumption may lead to an allergic reaction that can be fatal. Funnels (Clitocybe and Infundibulicybe) have funnel-shaped fruitbodies and range from small to large in size. ### Chunk 15 Some funnels are edible, but certain small, whitish funnels that grow on grassland are very poisonous. Chanterelles are funnel-shaped or cone-shaped with a solid or hollow stem and show irregularly branched veins on the cap's underside. ### Chunk 16 Chanterelles grow on the ground and form mycorrhizal associations with trees; all are edible. The chanterelles are among the best edible mushrooms, known for their unique taste and firm consistency. ### Chunk 17 Common Chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees, especially spruce, pine, and beech on poor soils. They can be found during summer and autumn alongside roads and tracks in spruce or pine plantations. ### Chunk 18 False Chanterelle (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) resembles a thin-fleshed and very orange Common Chanterelle but has regularly forked gills. It is generally considered edible but may cause stomach upsets. ### Chunk 19 Pale Chanterelle (Cantharellus pallens) is similar to Common Chanterelle but has thicker, larger, and more fleshy fruitbodies. It has a fine taste and structure and prefers clay soil, particularly in forests with slopes. ### Chunk 20 Yellow chanterelles form solid, apricot-yellow fruitbodies with irregularly branched veins that run from the cap margin down the stem. They are among the best edible mushrooms and have a strong taste, especially when cooked.

Chunk 16:
### Chunk 1 Other similar fungi: the most obvious candidate for misidentification is False Chanterelle, which is soft-fleshed and has true gills with a regularly forked branching pattern. The underside of the Common Chanterelle is covered by branched veins.  ### Chunk 2 Common Chanterelles can be found in abundance on the floor of conifer forests. In Norway or Sweden, there is a good chance of finding the species. Unlike Trumpet Chanterelle, Golden Chanterelle prefers calcareous soils and forms mycorrhizal associations with conifers. ### Chunk 3 Golden Chanterelle (Craterellus lutescens) is very similar to Trumpet Chanterelle but has only very shallow wrinkles under the cap. It is a fine edible fungus, but it is very rare in Britain and Ireland. ### Chunk 4 The Jellybaby (Leotia lubrica) can be confused with young trumpet chanterelles. Its fruit bodies consist of a yellow, somewhat slimy stem with a greyer, rather globular head on top. The whole fruit body has a rubbery consistency. ### Chunk 5 Although Jellybaby is not poisonous, it has no value as an edible fungus. It often grows with beech, so if you collect your Trumpet Chanterelles in deciduous woods, you may well find a Jellybaby among them. ### Chunk 6 While chanterelles are basidiomycetes, Jellybaby belongs to the other major group of fungi: the Ascomycota. The brown chanterelles are thin-fleshed and have a hollow stem and brownish cap colors.  ### Chunk 7 The underside of brown chanterelles is covered by shallow, branched wrinkles or veins. They are excellent edible mushrooms and, although they may not be quite on par with their yellow cousins, they can often be found in abundance. ### Chunk 8 Brown chanterelles are suitable for drying due to their thin flesh. Trumpet Chanterelle (Craterellus tubaeformis) has well-developed veins underneath the cap and is found on poor soil with mycorrhiza-forming trees. ### Chunk 9 It can grow in large quantities in young spruce plantations, but also in beech woods. It typically fruits rather late, from September to November. Horn of Plenty is good fried, but it also works well in sauces and pies. ### Chunk 10 Horn of Plenty (Craterellus cornucopioides) is an excellent edible mushroom with a strong taste and good consistency. Its hollow, funnel-shaped, black fruit bodies vary in size from a few to 15 centimeters tall in old specimens. ### Chunk 11 Blackening Brittlegill (Russula nigricans) forms large fruit bodies with stem, cap, and gills. These are initially grey-brown but mummify into black 'corpses' that can be confused with Horn of Plenty. ### Chunk 12 Horn of Plenty prefers nutrient-rich, clay soil and forms mycorrhizal associations with beech. It is common in old beech forests, often found with Trumpet Chanterelle and Pale Chanterelle (Cantharellus pallens). ### Chunk 13 The Crab Brittlegill (Russula xerampelina) is characterized by its red cap and stem, which turns brown after bruising. The gills are pale yellow, and the taste is mild, acquiring a strong seafood odor with age. ### Chunk 14 Crab Brittlegill most often grows with pine trees and is found in conifer plantations in September and October. Young Crab Brittlegills are delicious when fried and stewed with cream. ### Chunk 15 Brittlegills are mushrooms with crisp flesh, lacking longitudinal fibers and veils, meaning they never have a ring on the stem. They form mycorrhizal associations with trees and have white or yellowish spores. ### Chunk 16 No European species of brittlegills are poisonous, but many can taste hot. Other similar groups of fungi include the poisonous amanitas, which have a veil that remains as a ring on the fibrous stem. ### Chunk 17 The Sickener (Russula emetica) is one of the most common very hot brittlegills, recognizable by its bright red cap, contrasting with the pure white stem and gills. If in doubt, carefully place the tip of the tongue against the gills of a fresh fruit body.

Chunk 17:
### Chunk 1 Although probably not really poisonous, The Sickener is simply absolutely inedible because of its taste – which technically is not a taste, but a pain (do not rub your eyes by mistake after handling the mushroom!). The very similar Beechwood Sickener (Russula mariei) is common in beech woods and is also inedible. **Question:** Why is The Sickener considered inedible, and what is a similar mushroom that is also inedible? --- ### Chunk 2 Other similar fungi include the Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria), which has fibrous stem flesh and a partial veil that is left as a ring around the stem. The young fungus is also wrapped in a white universal veil, which is later left as white scales on the cap. Brittlegills, on the other hand, have no veils at all. But beware: the veil remnants are loose, and rain can wash them away and leave the cap completely smooth and red! **Question:** How can the Fly Agaric be distinguished from brittlegills, and what happens to the veil remnants in rain? --- ### Chunk 3 Among other red brittlegills, the mild species are harmless, while the hot ones are inedible. The most common hot species in coniferous forests is The Sickener. There are several good edible species among the mild-tasting, bright red brittlegills. Crab Brittlegill is an excellent edible mushroom, and the Hintapink is also good and can be collected in large quantities during summer. **Question:** What distinguishes mild-tasting brittlegills from hot-tasting ones, and can you name an edible red brittlegill? --- ### Chunk 4 Hintapink (Russula paludosa) is a large edible red brittlegill. It forms fruit bodies with whitish to cream gills, a white stem with red flushes, and a shiny orange-red to red cap. It has no noticeable smell but often tastes a bit hot when raw. Hintapink grows with spruce and pine on poor soil. It is rather common in Scotland but rare or absent elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. **Question:** Describe the characteristics of Hintapink and its habitat. --- ### Chunk 5 It typically fruits as early as July and lasts until October. Despite the slightly hot taste, Hintapink is a good edible mushroom when cooked. There are many hot-tasting brittlegills with greyish-red colours. Fragile Brittlegill (Russula fragilis) is one of the more common. **Question:** When is Hintapink typically harvested, and how does cooking affect its edibility? --- ### Chunk 6 Fragile Brittlegill is easily recognized by its finely serrated gill edge (best seen with a lens) and its habitat on poor soils with oak. The Fragile Brittlegill is one of many species which taste so strong that you just have to touch the gills with the tip of your tongue to ‘burn’ yourself. **Question:** How can you identify Fragile Brittlegill, and what is notable about its taste? --- ### Chunk 7 Darkening Brittlegill (Russula vinosa) is a large brittlegill with a shiny, greyish wine-coloured cap, cream gills, and a white stem. With age, the gills, stem, and flesh turn grey. It has a mild taste and is a fine edible mushroom. Scattered in old coniferous forests and plantations in Scotland, Darkening Brittlegill is not known elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. **Question:** What are the distinguishing features of Darkening Brittlegill, and where is it commonly found? --- ### Chunk 8 Olive Brittlegill (Russula olivacea) is a very large brittlegill with a dull, wine-coloured cap, which often also has olive green shades. The gills become yellow with age, and the stem is white with red tones, especially as a red collar at the top. The taste is mild, and it is an acceptably edible mushroom. **Question:** What are the characteristics of Olive Brittlegill, and how does its appearance change with age? --- ### Chunk 9 If you find a large, mild-tasting beech forest brittlegill, with a red collar at the top of the stem, it is surely an Olive Brittlegill. Make sure to fry them thoroughly, as raw specimens may cause upset stomachs in some people. **Question:** What precautions should be taken when consuming Olive Brittlegill? --- ### Chunk 10 The Flirt (Russula vesca), also known as Bare-toothed Brittlegill, is one of our better-tasting brittlegills. It forms medium-sized fruit bodies with a rather characteristic, pale greyish-red cap colour and mild taste. The stem and gills are white. **Question:** What makes The Flirt a desirable edible mushroom, and how can it be identified? --- ### Chunk 11 As a diagnostic feature, the cap cuticle barely reaches all the way to the edge, so especially older specimens ‘show their teeth’ along the cap margin. Very common during late summer and autumn in beech woods, The Flirt can also grow with other deciduous trees and with conifers. **Question:** What unique feature helps identify older specimens of The Flirt? --- ### Chunk 12 Ochre Brittlegill (Russula ochroleuca) is a medium-sized brittlegill with a dull yellow cap, whitish gills, and a whitish stem that turns more grey with age. It tastes somewhat hot and has no value as an edible mushroom. Ochre Brittlegill grows in both deciduous woodlands and coniferous forests. **Question:** Why is Ochre Brittlegill not considered an edible mushroom? --- ### Chunk 13 Geranium Brittlegill (Russula fellea) is a rather small brittlegill with pale brownish-yellow fruit bodies. Unlike other yellowish brittlegills, the cap, stem, and gills have pretty much the same colour. The taste is burning hot, and the mushroom is therefore inedible. **Question:** How can Geranium Brittlegill be identified, and what is its taste profile? --- ### Chunk 14 There are several good edible mushrooms among mild brittlegills with orange and yellow caps, but the most common yellow species, Ochre Brittlegill, is unfortunately not one of them. Copper Brittlegill (Russula decolorans) is a large, orange brittlegill that grows with pine on sandy soil. **Question:** What are the characteristics of Copper Brittlegill, and how does it differ from Ochre Brittlegill? --- ### Chunk 15 The gills are cream-coloured, and the stem is white. With age, the stem, gills, and flesh turn grey, just like the Darkening Brittlegill. Copper Brittlegill tastes mild and is a fine edible fungus. It is rather rare in Scotland and absent further south but quite common in Scandinavian pine forests. **Question:** What changes occur in the appearance of Copper Brittlegill as it ages? --- ### Chunk 16 Yellow Swamp Brittlegill (Russula claroflava) is a large, bright yellow brittlegill with cream-coloured gills. As in Copper Brittlegill, the stem, gills, and flesh turn grey with age, and the taste is mild. Yellow Swamp Brittlegill grows on peat soil with birch and is widespread in Britain and Ireland. **Question:** What are the identifying features of Yellow Swamp Brittlegill, and where does it typically grow? --- ### Chunk 17 Charcoal Burner (Russula cyanoxantha) is another brittlegill that can be quite common in August and September. It has a rather unique character; the gills of Charcoal Burner are soft and greasy and do not break when rubbed with a finger.  **Question:** What is unique about the gills of Charcoal Burner, and when is it typically found?  --- ### Chunk 18 Greencracked Brittlegill (Russula virescens) is a firm, hard-fleshed brittlegill with a grey-green cap. Upon expansion, the cap cuticle breaks into a chequered pattern. **Question:** How can Greencracked Brittlegill be identified based on its cap characteristics?

Chunk 18:
**Chunk 1: Green Brittlegill and Charcoal Burner** The stem and gills are white, and the taste is mild. Scattered in southerly, warm beech woods on clay soils, this species is able to form fruitbodies under very dry conditions and is therefore often found as early as August. Greencracked Brittlegill is a good edible fungus. Charcoal Burner (Russula cyanoxantha) can have many colours. Most often, the cap is dominated by light green, but there are usually also areas with more grey and lilac tones. The stem and gills are white. **Chunk 2: Green Brittlegill Characteristics** Green Brittlegill (Russula aeruginea) has delicate, grass-green caps, whitish gills, and a white stem. It tastes mild and is a good edible mushroom. Green Brittlegill always grows with birch trees. It prefers slightly poor soils in lawns, parks, and along roadsides. It is widespread and common from August to October. There are several good edible mushrooms among the green brittlegills. Many are difficult to identify to species, but all completely green mild-tasting brittlegills are edible. **Chunk 3: Identifying Brittlegills** Remember that brittlegills are naked: they never have a veil, neither around the young fruitbody nor as a cover over the gills and thus never display a volva or a ring. These are important and distinctive characteristics of poisonous amanitas. Other similar fungi include the Deathcap (Amanita phalloides), which is deadly poisonous and may resemble green brittlegills. When young, it is completely wrapped in a veil that is later left as a volva at the base. **Chunk 4: Other Similar Fungi** Green-capped species of Roundhead (Stropharia) have a ring on the stem and their gills become grey-black, coloured by maturing spores. They are not poisonous. Milkcaps form mycorrhizal associations with trees and are therefore mostly found in woods, forests, and parkland, with both coniferous and deciduous trees. In mountain areas, you may also find milkcaps in low scrub of willow and mountain avens. **Chunk 5: Edibility of Milkcaps** If you avoid species with water-clear milk, all other mild-tasting milkcaps can be eaten. The colour of the milk is a very important character, so old, dried-out fruitbodies without milk should be avoided. There are no dangerously poisonous fungi among the milkcaps, but many species taste hot and are completely inedible. Fenugreek Milkcap (Lactarius helvus), which has water-clear milk, may cause stomach upsets. **Chunk 6: Characteristics of Milkcaps** Milkcaps are, put simply, brittlegills with a milk-like juice, most easily seen if you cut the gills with the tip of a knife. The flesh is crisp and without longitudinal fibres. The milkcaps often form large, fleshy fruitbodies with more-or-less decurrent gills. The milk can be white, purple, pink, yellow, or clear as water. **Chunk 7: Oakbug Milkcap and Fishy Milkcap** Oakbug Milkcap (Lactarius quietus) is one of the most common milkcaps. Its dull, grey-brown cap shows concentric darker zones and has copious white milk. The taste is mild, and the smell is somewhat unpleasantly spicy (but not fishy). Fishy Milkcap (Lactifluus volemus) forms very compact fruitbodies with a characteristic dull, orange-brown colour on the cap and stem. When cut, the gills will secrete an abundance of white milk, which becomes brown upon drying. **Chunk 8: Other Brown Milkcaps** Birch Milkcap (Lactarius tabidus) is one among many small, brown milkcaps with mild, white milk. None of these are considered good edible mushrooms, but they are all quite harmless. Rufous Milkcap (Lactarius rufus) is one of the very hot-tasting milkcaps. It forms medium-sized, reddish-brown fruitbodies with a small, pointed peak in the middle of the cap. The milk is white. **Chunk 9: False Saffron Milkcap and Saffron Milkcap** False Saffron Milkcap (Lactarius deterrimus) forms orange fruitbodies with sparse orange milk. The stem is smooth without the pitted surface found on the Saffron Milkcap. With age and after bruising, parts of the cap turn green. Saffron Milkcap (Lactarius deliciosus) is the best edible fungus in the group. It forms very firm, pale orange fruitbodies, and the stems are pitted with small, darker cavities where small drops of juice have gathered and dried.  **Chunk 10: Conclusion on Milkcaps** Milkcaps with a very hot taste are not considered poisonous, but are for obvious reasons not really edible either.

Chunk 19:
### Chunk 1 In some species, the hot taste can be removed through salting. The Ugly Milkcap (Lactarius necator) is a large, very hot-tasting milkcap that grows on nutrient-poor soil with birch and conifers. Its cap is predominantly brownish-green, and it has white milk. Ugly Milkcap is completely inedible because of the taste. The same goes for the super-hot Rufous Milkcap. ### Chunk 2 The species in the bearded milkcap group have whitish to pinkish caps with a fringing ‘beard’ at the cap margin. Their milk is white and very hot. These species are usually not considered edible, but it is possible to remove the hot taste by salting the mushrooms. Salted milkcaps are popular in Eastern Europe and, after cooking, they develop a strong, slightly meat-like taste. ### Chunk 3 The two most common species in this group are the pale pink Woolly Milkcap (Lactarius torminosus) and the paler Bearded Milkcap (Lactarius pubescens). Both grow with birch and are widespread and very common throughout autumn. Fenugreek Milkcap (Lactarius helvus) is the only milkcap that is considered poisonous. ### Chunk 4 Fenugreek Milkcap forms large fruitbodies with a dry, somewhat scaly cap surface and brownish colors. Its milk is unique for being clear as water. It tastes mild and has a smell reminiscent of curry or stock cubes. Fenugreek Milkcap grows with deciduous and coniferous trees on poor, moist soils. It can be used sparingly as a spice for soups, but eating it in larger quantities may result in a stomach upset. ### Chunk 5 Velvet Shank (Flammulina velutipes) is a common winter fungus. Its fruitbodies are small, with a brownish-orange and very slimy cap and whitish gills. The stem has a pale top but gradually becomes dark with a velvety surface below. This fungus is found on various deciduous trees from November to March. ### Chunk 6 There are several very similar species in the genus, but they are all edible. Velvet Shank is not among the best edible mushrooms due to its slimy cap and mild taste. However, it is common at a time of year when there is not much else to find. The Enokitake mushrooms sold in supermarkets are shanks grown in the dark. ### Chunk 7 The agarics form a cap with gills beneath. The cap is usually borne on top of a stem. Unlike brittlegills and milkcaps, the stem flesh is structured with longitudinal fibers. Agarics are one of the largest fungal groups, with fruitbodies that can vary in size from a few millimeters to over half a meter in diameter. ### Chunk 8 The spore color is an important identification feature, and agarics are divided into white-spored, pink-spored, black-spored, and brown-spored species. Unfortunately, spore colors are not always easy to judge. The safest method is to make a spore deposit, but one can also learn a lot just by looking at the gills of both young and old fruitbodies. ### Chunk 9 If the gills change color with age, they are probably colored by the maturing spores. The white-spored agarics are the most difficult group to recognize because white spores do not effectively mask other colors. Thus, the agarics with whitish spores are divided into categories based on their gill attachment. ### Chunk 10 Certain species of Pinkgill (Entoloma) are poisonous. Some species are small and slender, while others are large and fleshy and can be mistaken for edible mushrooms. Pinkgills have more distant gills than St George’s Mushroom. Though often whitish or yellowish at first, the gills become colored by the pink spores as they age. Pinkgills are found in both wooded habitats and open land.

Chunk 20:
### Chunk 1: St George’s Mushroom Overview St George’s Mushroom (Calocybe gambosa) is commonly found half-hidden in spring vegetation. These mushrooms grow in lawns and in deciduous and coniferous forests on well-mixed, humus-rich soils. They often form large fairy rings and fruit from April to June. This mushroom is considered edible, provided it is fried thoroughly to eliminate its flour-like taste and smell. ### Chunk 2: Characteristics of St George’s Mushroom St George’s Mushrooms typically form medium-sized fruit bodies that are usually white or cream-colored, with caps that may turn light brown when very wet. The gills are noticeably crowded together. The fruit body has a farinaceous, or flour-like, taste and smell, which is more reminiscent of cucumber or watermelon rather than modern white flour. ### Chunk 3: Safety Precautions and Similar Fungi For safety, it is advised to start with a small portion of St George’s Mushroom, using only young specimens and frying them well to remove the strong smell of bitter almonds. There are similar fungi to be cautious of, including small, white funnels (Clitocybe) that can be very poisonous, and various brittlegills and milkcaps (Russula and Lactarius) that may be very hot but are not poisonous. ### Chunk 4: Fairy Rings and Giant Funnel Fairy rings, visible even without fruit bodies, appear unusually green and lush due to nutrients released by the fungus. The Giant Funnel (Aspropaxillus giganteus) can cause stomach problems in some individuals, but is generally considered a fine edible fungus. It grows in woods, gardens, and open habitats, often forming large, conspicuous fairy rings. ### Chunk 5: Characteristics of Giant Funnel Giant Funnel forms huge fruit bodies with a somewhat funnel-shaped, whitish cap, decurrent gills, and a short fibrous, white stem. The caps can exceed 30 cm in width, and a distinctive feature is that the gills can easily be detached from the cap flesh. ### Chunk 6: Dark Honey Fungus and Bulbous Honey Fungus Dark Honey Fungus (Armillaria ostoyae) has a robust ring and dark scales on the cap, primarily growing on coniferous wood and fruiting in late autumn. It may be more difficult to digest than other species of Honey Fungus. Bulbous Honey Fungus (Armillaria lutea) has a fluffy ring and yellowish scales on young specimens, commonly found on the wood and roots of deciduous trees. ### Chunk 7: Shaggy Scalycap and Honey Fungus Shaggy Scalycap (Pholiota squarrosa) may be confused with Honey Fungus, but its young gills are pale yellow and darken with age. Honey fungi are generally edible but can cause stomach pain and vomiting if eaten raw. They are typically found in late September and October. ### Chunk 8: Garlic Parachute Overview Garlic Parachute (Mycetinis alliaceus) has a strong garlic smell and grows on wood in beech forests. It resembles the Fairy Ring Champignon but has a long, felted, dark brown stem. This fungus is common in old southern beech woods and can be found from August to October. ### Chunk 9: Culinary Uses of Garlic Parachute Due to its insubstantial size and strong flavor, Garlic Parachute is not a typical edible mushroom but can be used as a spice for those seeking a garlic flavor without using actual garlic.

Chunk 21:
### Chunk 1 **Fairy Ring Champignon (Marasmius oreades)** forms fairy rings with numerous small, beige-coloured fruitbodies. They have adnexed, distant gills and a characteristic smell of bitter almonds.  ### Chunk 2 **Other similar fungi:** There are lots of small fungi in lawns and fields, but none grow in fairy rings and have the combination of such pale brown colour, distant gills, and the smell of bitter almonds. Fairy Ring Champignon is one of the most common species in lawns.  ### Chunk 3 Its fairy rings often show a zone of dead grass and are therefore visible all year round. It is a reasonable, albeit small, edible mushroom, but it must be thoroughly fried before being eaten. ### Chunk 4 **Brown Parasol (Chlorophyllum brunneum)** is very similar to a small species of Macrolepiota, but has a smooth stem which does not crack into a snakeskin pattern and a simple ring. It grows in gardens and greenhouses and can cause upset stomachs in some people. ### Chunk 5 There are several other very similar species of the genus Chlorophyllum that are edible. These, like the Giant Parasol, have a double, loose ring at the stem.  ### Chunk 6 **Panthercap (Amanita pantherina)** may also look a bit like a parasol, but is smaller and has a non-cracked cap covered with scales, which are the white, loose remnants of the universal veil. It also has a single, hanging ring firmly attached around the white stem. ### Chunk 7 Panthercap, like all amanitas, forms mycorrhizal associations with trees. It will therefore never grow in open landscapes, which is where you will often find the Giant Parasol. Panthercap contains some neurotoxins that can cause severe but fortunately not fatal poisonings. ### Chunk 8 **Giant Parasol (Macrolepiota procera)** forms very large, stately fruitbodies with scaly caps up to 30 cm wide. The very young cap is smooth, but as it unfolds it cracks into large scales. ### Chunk 9 In time, only the area in the middle of the cap remains whole and brown, while the rest shows the whitish, exposed flesh with scattered, brown scales. The gills are white and free, and the young gills are covered by a membranous veil. ### Chunk 10 This later forms a characteristic double ring that hangs loose so that it can be moved up and down the stem without breaking. The surface of the stem cracks into a dark and white snakeskin pattern. ### Chunk 11 Giant Parasol grows in woods, fields, and dunes, and is especially frequent in coastal areas. It is most common in the southern parts of Britain (more scattered in Ireland) and fruits in late summer and early autumn. ### Chunk 12 If you try to fry a Giant Parasol it will just absorb all the fat you throw at it and not become crisp. ### Chunk 13 **Deathcap (Amanita phalloides)** is deadly poisonous. Just a single fruitbody can be enough to cause liver failure and kill an adult. Deathcap is responsible for the vast majority of fatal mushroom poisonings in western Europe. ### Chunk 14 Deathcap forms medium-sized, beautiful fruitbodies with a pale green, yellowish, or pale grey cap. The gills are white and free, and produce white spores. The stem has a somewhat cracked surface and often carries the remnants of the partial veil as a hanging ring. ### Chunk 15 In some mature fruitbodies, the ring is confusingly absent: here the veil may instead remain as fragments hanging from the cap margin. At the base of the stem is a bulb, and around this, you will see the remains of the universal veil – the volva. ### Chunk 16 Deathcap is very common in beech and oak woods, especially in southern parts of Britain and Ireland. It fruits mainly during August and September. ### Chunk 17 The toxins start working long after the mushrooms have been eaten, and it is too late to perform stomach pumping. Treatment consists of eating activated charcoal and strong antibiotics, but there are no effective antidotes. ### Chunk 18 The toxins destroy liver cells, and poisonings may end in liver failure and death. The amanitas form mycorrhizal associations with trees and are therefore found only near suitable tree species in woods, gardens, and parks. ### Chunk 19 Many amanitas are poisonous, but there are also edible species. The poisonous species contain a wide range of toxins, the most dangerous of which are the amatoxins found in Deathcap. ### Chunk 20 Any book on edible fungi must include, with appropriate warnings, the most poisonous amanitas. Once you are familiar with Deathcap, Destroying Angel, and Fly Agaric, you will feel a lot safer identifying edible species. ### Chunk 21 **Amanitas (Amanita)** are recognizable by their white, adnexed or free gills and by the membranous universal veil that surrounds the young fruitbodies. The universal veil protects the young fruitbody from insect infestation and dehydration. ### Chunk 22 When the fruitbody matures, the veil bursts and is left either as a volva around the base of the stem or as white scales on the cap surface. As the fruitbody expands, the partial veil remains as either a ring around the stem or fragments hanging from the margin of the cap (or both). ### Chunk 23 **Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria)** forms large fruitbodies with red or orange caps. Remains of the universal veil are usually left on the cap as the characteristic white, loose scales, but after rain, these may wash away and the cap can then become completely naked. ### Chunk 24 The gills are white and free or rarely adnexed, and the stem is white and carries a large, eye-catching ring. Since the universal veil is mainly left on the cap, Fly Agaric has no volva at the base. ### Chunk 25 Fly Agaric forms mycorrhizal associations with many different trees, but is especially frequent with birch and spruce on nutrient-poor soil. It is common throughout Britain and Ireland and can be found fruiting from September to November. ### Chunk 26 **Other similar fungi:** See the discussion under the red brittlegills. Fly Agaric is poisonous but hardly deadly. It contains a cocktail of various toxins, but not the very dangerous amatoxins found in Deathcap and Destroying Angel.

Chunk 22:
### Chunk 1 On the other hand, a young, sectioned Fly Agaric can easily be confused with white species of Agaricus. The gills of Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa) and other amanitas remain white throughout their lives, while the gills of Agaricus species soon turn light grey or pink, eventually changing to dark chocolate-brown at maturity. ### Chunk 2 False Deathcap (Amanita citrina) is very similar to the Destroying Angel but has a more symmetrical, rounded cap and smells like raw potato. This species is not poisonous but is too difficult to identify to be considered safe to eat. ### Chunk 3 Destroying Angel forms medium-sized, slender, white fruitbodies with white spores. The cap is rather high and usually a little asymmetrical. The gills are free, and the stem is long and somewhat frayed. The partial veil is typically left on the stem as a hanging ring, and at the base, there is a bulb surrounded by a white volva, the remnants of the universal veil. ### Chunk 4 Destroying Angel grows mostly on poorer soil, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with trees such as beech, oak, spruce, and pine. It contains the same toxins as Deathcap, making it just as poisonous. The Deathcap is responsible for most fatalities, likely because it is more common in urban areas. ### Chunk 5 Other similar fungi include violet species of Webcap (Cortinarius), recognizable by their thread-like veil between the stem and cap margin in young fruitbodies and by their rusty brown spores. Some species of Webcap are poisonous. ### Chunk 6 Amethyst Deceiver (Laccaria amethystina) is smaller with a thinner stem (3–6 mm) and very distant gills. It is not poisonous. The violet blewits (Lepista) form medium-sized fruitbodies with pale brownish-pink spores, emarginate gills, and violet or purple colours on the gills and/or stem. ### Chunk 7 Blewits are decomposers that grow in both woodlands and open habitats. They often form large fairy rings. All blewits are edible, but some people do not like their somewhat perfumed taste and smell. However, they are generally considered good and safe edible mushrooms. ### Chunk 8 Field Blewit (Lepista saeva) resembles a large, pale, grey-brown version of Wood Blewit, with only the stem showing a lilac shade. It is salt-tolerant and characteristic of coastal pastures, having also spread to roadsides affected by winter salting. ### Chunk 9 Wood Blewit (Lepista nuda) is a medium-sized agaric with violet gills, a violet stem, and a violet to brownish cap. The cap surface is smooth and greasy, and the stem is 5–20 mm thick with a fine, fluffy pattern. It prefers woodland habitats and is common and edible. ### Chunk 10 Agaricus species typically decompose organic matter in soil or manure, living in woodlands and open countryside. About 40 species exist in the UK, many of which are difficult to differentiate. Many species of Agaricus form fairy rings, which can fragment over time. ### Chunk 11 Members of the genus Agaricus have fleshy fruitbodies with dark chocolate-brown spores and free gills. They have a partial veil that covers the young gills and later hangs as a ring around the stem. All species, except the Yellow Stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus), are edible. ### Chunk 12 Field Mushroom (Agaricus campestris) forms small to medium-sized fruitbodies with a white cap, pink to chocolate-brown gills, and a stem with a small, fragile ring. The flesh blushes slowly when cut and smells faintly of mushroom. Field Mushrooms are common in lawns, parks, and grasslands. ### Chunk 13 Scaly Wood Mushroom (Agaricus langei) is a medium-sized, brown-capped Agaricus that reddens immediately and strongly when bruised. It has brown gills and a well-developed ring with a cogwheel-like underside. It is a fine edible fungus with a pleasant smell.

Chunk 23:
### Chunk 1 Scaly Wood Mushroom grows in both deciduous woods and coniferous forests and fruits during autumn. There are several similar species, all of which are edible.  ### Chunk 2 Yellow Stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus) forms medium-sized fruitbodies with a slightly angular cap. It can be chalk-white or greyish and has a well-developed ring with a coarse-toothed cogwheel beneath. If you scratch a young and fresh fruitbody at the cap margin, this immediately turns bright yellow.  ### Chunk 3 This reaction is usually also seen in the flesh of the stem base. If the fungus is dry, moisten your finger with saliva before rubbing. The smell is unpleasant and chemical (like phenol) and as an extra warning, the smell is amplified if the fruitbodies end up in a hot pan.  ### Chunk 4 Some people can eat the Yellow Stainer without any problems, but in most it causes a stomach upset. It should therefore be avoided. Yellow Stainers are mostly found in parks and cemeteries, where they may be quite common during summer and autumn. ### Chunk 5 Horse Mushroom mostly grows in lawns and fields, and fruits from early summer to autumn. There are several closely related species with the same culinary properties, such as the more long-stemmed Wood Mushroom (Agaricus silvicola), which prefers to grow in woods and forests.  ### Chunk 6 The brown-capped Prince (Agaricus augustus) is found in parks, gardens, and open woodland. All are excellent edible fungi. Royals are Agaricus species with strong marzipan-like smells and which slowly turn yellow when bruised.  ### Chunk 7 Royals are all excellent edible mushrooms. Unfortunately, they have the ability to concentrate the heavy metal cadmium, and so they should not be eaten in very large quantities. One should also avoid fruitbodies from potentially contaminated places, such as roadsides in towns and cities. ### Chunk 8 Other similar fungi include the Destroying Angel (deadly poisonous) which always has white gills. Yellow Stainer turns deep yellow immediately when scratched at the cap margin and smells of chemicals, potentially causing stomach upsets. ### Chunk 9 Horse Mushroom (Agaricus arvensis) forms medium to large, white fruitbodies which slowly turn yellow where bruised. You typically do not notice the yellowing reaction upon picking, but after an hour in the basket, the pale yellow spots on the cap and stem are evident.  ### Chunk 10 Like all royals, it has a well-developed ring with a cogwheel-like structure below. When fruitbodies are damaged, they emit a strong, delicious smell of marzipan, which becomes even more evident when cooked. ### Chunk 11 Common Inkcap (Coprinopsis atramentarius) is a fairly large inkcap that looks a lot like the Shaggy Inkcap. But where the Shaggy Inkcap cracks into large, white scales, Common Inkcap is smoother with only small, adpressed, brown flakes at the top.  ### Chunk 12 Common on roadsides and in gardens, this species is found in both spring and autumn. It is in principle edible, but contains the substance coprin, which affects the body’s ability to break down alcohol.  ### Chunk 13 Consumption of alcohol even several days after eating Common Inkcap can cause very unpleasant reactions, exactly like those after treatment with Antabuse. For safety’s sake, one should avoid eating it. ### Chunk 14 Shaggy Inkcap (Coprinus comatus), also known as Lawyer’s Wig, is the inkcap with the largest fruitbodies. When mature, they can easily grow to 40 cm tall, and even when very young, they provide a good basketful. ### Chunk 15 The young caps are whitish or light brown and much taller than wide. As soon as they mature, the surface begins to crack into large, curved scales. The stem is white and hollow and has a small, loose ring that easily falls off.  ### Chunk 16 The gills are white at first, but are soon coloured dark by maturing spores from the bottom upwards. Other similar fungi include other species of Inkcap with large fruitbodies, e.g., Common Inkcap, which do not have the characteristic white, curved scales. ### Chunk 17 Shaggy Inkcap fruits in September and October. It prefers disturbed places like lawns and stubble fields. It is a fine but very soft-fleshed edible mushroom, which can add flavor to a mushroom sauce or pie. ### Chunk 18 Inkcaps have free gills that dissolve at maturity and drip away as a black liquid (‘ink’). Many inkcaps have very crowded gills, but because these drip away from the outside in, the spores can still be shot freely into the air from basidia just above the dissolving area. ### Chunk 19 The crowded gills allow the fruitbodies to produce an incredible number of spores. Inkcaps are decomposers. Most form quite small fruitbodies and are completely uninteresting as edible mushrooms.  ### Chunk 20 Only Shaggy Inkcap, with its tall, white fruitbodies, can be used. The greatest value of Slimy Spike is that it is almost impossible to misidentify. Young fruitbodies may be used as a supplement to more tasty species while older specimens should be left in the forest. ### Chunk 21 Slimy Spike (Gomphidius glutinosus) has grey-brown caps with a slimy upper side. The slime is the remnants of a universal veil that protects the young fruitbodies from dehydration and predation by insects.  ### Chunk 22 The gills are decurrent and become grey as the black spores mature. The black spores are quite easy to see as they get caught in the slimy remnants of the veil at the top of the stem.  ### Chunk 23 The flesh of the stem base is strikingly yellow. The combination of decurrent gills, black spores, yellow stem base, and slimy cap makes this species unmistakable.  ### Chunk 24 Livid Pinkgill (Entoloma sinuatum) may look rather similar, but it has gills that eventually are coloured yellow-red by the pinkish spores and it has no ring. It grows in nutrient-rich deciduous woodlands and can cause severe stomach upsets and liver failure. ### Chunk 25 The Gypsy is a very fine edible fungus that is collected in many parts of the world. It forms mycorrhizal associations with deciduous and coniferous trees. Unfortunately, it is rare in Britain and Ireland, with most records coming from Scotland.

Chunk 24:
### Chunk 1 In more mountainous regions of Europe, including the Alps, Norway, and Sweden, The Gypsy is much more common. There are some very poisonous webcaps, but these are much more strongly coloured (either dark orange-brown or orange-yellow) and cannot really be confused with The Gypsy. Other similar fungi include webcaps (other species of Cortinarius), which do not have a well-defined ring but instead show a cobweb-like veil that covers the gills and is often left in fragments like woolly belts down the stem. ### Chunk 2 The Gypsy (Cortinarius caperatus) forms tall, elegant fruitbodies with a pale greyish-yellow cap, greyish-yellow gills, and a whitish stem that is slightly wider at the base. Young caps have small, flaky, pale scales. Around the stem sits a characteristic ring, which often has a small, protruding ridge from the middle. The ring is the remnants of a membranous veil that protects the young gills. The spores are rusty brown. ### Chunk 3 For many years, The Gypsy was placed in its own genus, Rozites, but it has been shown that this species belongs among the webcaps (Cortinarius) and is similar to these. The characteristic ring with a small protruding edge in the middle helps differentiate it from other fungi.  ### Chunk 4 Puffballs are decomposers and form spherical or pear-shaped fruitbodies, which at maturity become filled with brownish spores. When young, they are solid and uniformly white inside, making them edible. Puffballs belong to a group called stomach fungi, which develop spores inside the fruitbody and rely on external forces for spore release.  ### Chunk 5 Other fungi similar to puffballs include earthballs (Scleroderma), which resemble puffballs but have a tough outer crust and a black, marbled inner spore mass. They also emit an unpleasant metallic smell and are slightly poisonous. Young specimens of Amanita species wrapped in their universal veil may also look similar, but they contain deadly poisonous species. ### Chunk 6 Giant Puffball (Calvatia gigantea) is an interesting edible fungus. When young, it can be cut into centimetre-thick slices, coated in eggs and breadcrumbs or flour, and fried. The result has a surprisingly fine consistency and a mild taste. This species typically grows in nutrient-rich soil, such as in gardens and well-fertilized fields, and is found especially in southern Britain. ### Chunk 7 Giant Puffball forms huge, spherical fruitbodies that can resemble footballs or larger. As they mature, they fill with billions of brown spores and eventually look like giant, dusty bath sponges. While smaller puffballs may be confused with young amanitas, Giant Puffballs are much larger, making confusion unlikely. ### Chunk 8 Other similar fungi include Mosaic Puffball (Lycoperdon utriforme), which is the second largest puffball and is edible when young. Tripe Fungus has a much more hairy upper side and is not poisonous, but it is not considered an edible fungus either.  ### Chunk 9 Jelly Ear (Auricularia auricula-judae) forms medium-sized, ear-shaped, brown fruitbodies with a soft, cartilaginous consistency. The upper side is covered with small hairs, while the underside is smooth and somewhat wrinkled. Jelly Ear prefers to grow on elder but may also be found on many other deciduous trees. ### Chunk 10 Jelly fungi are jelly-like or cartilaginous basidiomycetes that mostly grow on wood. While there are no poisonous mushrooms among jelly fungi, most species are not considered edible due to their consistency. In Asian cuisine, two species are used: White Jelly Fungus (Tremella fuciformis) and an Asian species of Jelly Ear. ### Chunk 11 Leafy Brain (Phaeotremella foliacea) is similar to Jelly Ear but has even more jelly-like fruitbodies that are folded in a brain-like manner. It is not hairy and is found scattered in late autumn and winter. Tripe Fungus (Auricularia mesenterica) has protruding caps with a hairy upper side and is not considered an edible fungus, although it is not poisonous.
