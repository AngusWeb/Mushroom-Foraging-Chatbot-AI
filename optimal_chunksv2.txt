Chunk 1:
Chunk 1: Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, and in Britain and Ireland, there are many thousands of fungal species that form large fruitbodies. Correct identification of these fungi can be very challenging.

Chunk 2:
Chunk 2: Precise species identification often requires significant experience and the use of a microscope. Even experienced individuals may find it difficult to identify fungi accurately compared to other organisms like butterflies or plants.

Chunk 3:
Chunk 3: The best approach for identifying a collected fungus is often to narrow it down to the correct major mushroom group, such as boletes or cep group.

Chunk 4:
Chunk 4: The central objective is to enable recognition of major groups of edible mushrooms, including yellow chanterelles, blueing boletes with orange tube mouths, green brittlegills, or milkcaps with orange milk.

Chunk 5:
Chunk 5: These species groups are usually presented on spreads, where similar or problematic fungi are also shown for comparison.

Chunk 6:
Chunk 6: An introductory section provides essential information on what fungi to look for, where to find them, how to collect them, and how to prepare them.

Chunk 7:
Chunk 7: It is important to thoroughly read this introductory information, as it is key to mastering the skill of identification.

Chunk 8:
Chunk 8: The kingdom of Fungi is immensely species-rich, with an estimated 1.5 million fungal species on the planet. Fungi are the second largest group of higher organisms, surpassed only by insects.

Chunk 9:
Chunk 9: In Britain and Ireland, there are certainly more than 15,000 known fungal species, and exploration of fungal diversity continues to reveal numerous new species each year.

Chunk 10:
Chunk 10: Many fungal species do not form large fruitbodies and instead live as mycelia within soil and organic matter, remaining largely invisible until revealed through DNA analysis or cultivation.

Chunk 11:
Chunk 11: The life cycle of a fungus begins with a microscopic spore that germinates and forms a thin, tubular cell known as a hypha.

Chunk 12:
Chunk 12: If the hypha finds nutrients, it grows and branches, resulting in a network of branched hyphae called mycelium, which spreads in search of more nutrients.

Chunk 13:
Chunk 13: When a fungus thrives and finds enough food, it may eventually form fruitbodies, which are the fleshy structures visible in the woods during autumn.

Chunk 14:
Chunk 14: Within the fruitbodies, sexual reproduction occurs, producing large numbers of spores that are released to disperse the fungus.

Chunk 15:
Chunk 1: Fungi are neither plants nor animals; they belong to their own kingdom, the kingdom of Fungi. Unlike plants, fungi cannot perform photosynthesis, and unlike animals, they are composed of long cell chains called hyphae. The fungal individual consists of a branched network of hyphae that live in a nutrient substrate, such as a layer of leaves or a tree trunk.

Chunk 16:
Chunk 2: Decomposing fungi can thrive on a wide variety of nutritional sources, including foods, living plants, plant debris, tree trunks, dung, horn, feathers, and even unusual substrates like the coating of camera lenses, the emulsion of photographic film, and aviation fuel. Each substrate requires a specific fungal specialist capable of secreting the right enzymes to dissolve it.

Chunk 17:
Chunk 3: In a grassy field or the needle cover of a woodland floor, a decomposer fungus may find an abundant food source. The fungus can grow in all directions, and as fungal mycelia naturally form circular patches, large fungal circles can develop on the ground. As the fungi grow, they consume available nutrients, expanding outward while the center may become nutrient-depleted.

Chunk 18:
Chunk 4: Fairy rings can be formed by fungi as they grow, with some rings becoming visible only when fruitbodies appear in autumn. Other fairy rings can be identified by changes in the grassland itself, such as greener vegetation due to excess nutrients released by the growing mycelium or decayed brown rings caused by the fungus parasitizing the grass.

Chunk 19:
Chunk 5: Fungi cannot photosynthesize, so they must obtain energy from sugars generated by plants. This can occur through two main methods: decomposition or symbiosis. Decomposer fungi break down organic materials, absorbing sugar molecules through their hyphae to gain energy.

Chunk 20:
Chunk 6: Many species of fungi are adept at breaking down complex organic substances such as cellulose and lignin found in plant cell walls. This ability allows fungi to act as a universal waste disposal system in nature, recycling dead organic matter and preventing the accumulation of dead plants.

Chunk 21:
Chunk 7: The visible part of a fungus is often just the small fruitbodies, while a large mycelium spreads beneath the surface, often through layers of branches and conifer needles.

Chunk 22:
Chunk 8: Some wood decomposers not only attack weakened or dead trees but also living trees, which helps them prepare their own food while outcompeting other species. Parasites such as Root Rot (Heterobasidion) can cause significant financial losses in the forestry industry.

Chunk 23:
Chunk 9: Decomposing wood is a challenging task due to its high cellulose and lignin content. Breaking it down requires advanced enzyme systems. Some edible fungi, like Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa) and Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus), thrive as wood decomposers, while others, like Dry Rot (Serpula lacrymans), can cause damage to damp wood in structures.

Chunk 24:
Chunk 10: Fungi and trees are interdependent; if fungi are absent, woodlands may struggle, and fungi cannot grow and produce fruitbodies without their tree partners. Some fungi can form mycorrhizal associations with specific trees, while others can partner with multiple tree species.

Chunk 25:
Chunk 11: Mycorrhizal associations create a complex network between trees and fungi, allowing nutrients to migrate freely. Sugars produced by trees through photosynthesis can flow to smaller trees, facilitating a symbiotic relationship.

Chunk 26:
Chunk 12: Ectomycorrhiza is a type of mycorrhizal association involving edible fungi like boletes and chanterelles. In this association, the plant partner is typically a tree, such as beech, oak, or pine, and the branched mycorrhizal roots are located near the soil surface.

Chunk 27:
Chunk 13: A mycorrhizal association is a coexistence of a fungus and a plant, where the two partners remain separate organisms. Fungal mycelia grow around and into plant roots, extending the root system and enhancing the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients.

Chunk 28:
Chunk 14: Mutual symbiosis involves several organisms coexisting to benefit all participants. Many fungi engage in symbiosis with photosynthesizing plants, gaining direct access to sugars produced by photosynthesis. This symbiosis can take the form of lichen formation or mycorrhizal relationships.

Chunk 29:
Chunk 15: In lichen formation, fungi create flat or branched structures that house single-celled green algae. The algae produce sugars for the fungi, while the fungi provide protection for the algae, allowing both symbionts to thrive together.

Chunk 30:
Chunk 1: Ectomycorrhiza are a type of fungal association that connects the roots of trees, such as spruce and beech, in a complex network. This network allows for the flow of minerals and nutrients between the trees and the fungi, facilitating a symbiotic relationship.

Chunk 31:
Chunk 2: A small root system may host various mycorrhizal fungi, including yellowish, reddish, and greenish species. The presence of these fungi is crucial for the health of the plants involved in the symbiosis.

Chunk 32:
Chunk 3: The fungal flora in ancient grassland ecosystems can be diverse, featuring many species of beautiful waxcaps (Hygrocybe), club fungi (Clavaria), and pinkgills (Entoloma). However, edible mushroom species are often limited in these environments.

Chunk 33:
Chunk 4: The application of artificial fertilizer can devastate the grassland flora and fungi, leading to the invasion of less desirable plants such as sorrels, nettles, thistles, and cockâ€™s-foot, along with species of Agaricus.

Chunk 34:
Chunk 5: The open landscape primarily consists of fields and meadows, many of which are heavily fertilized with either artificial or organic fertilizers. Rainfall can also introduce nitrogen from agricultural runoff into these areas.

Chunk 35:
Chunk 6: Edible mushrooms are commonly found in grazed fields within the open landscape. Species such as blewits (Lepista), funnels (Clitocybe and Aspropaxillus), parasols (Macrolepiota and Chlorophyllum), Agaricus, and puffballs (Lycoperdon and Calvatia) thrive in these conditions.

Chunk 36:
Chunk 7: Impressive fairy rings formed by mushrooms can be observed from a distance and even captured in aerial photographs. These formations are often found in areas where the vegetation has been grazed for long periods.

Chunk 37:
Chunk 8: On steep slopes that are difficult to plough, grassland may be found that has been extensively grazed by livestock and has not been subjected to artificial fertilizers. This environment often supports a variety of herbs and grasses.

Chunk 38:
Chunk 9: When searching for mushrooms, it is important to recognize that they can be found in various natural environments, which can be categorized into four main types: open landscapes, parks, churchyards and cemeteries, coniferous forests, and deciduous woodlands.

Chunk 39:
Chunk 10: In Scotland, there is a Right to Roam policy that allows access to almost all land, except for immediate areas surrounding private dwellings. In England and Wales, open access rights cover about 8% of land, primarily in upland areas.

Chunk 40:
Chunk 11: In Ireland, access to land is more restricted, with few public footpaths available. General access is often limited to National Parks, and rights for recreational purposes may exclude the collection of mushrooms and other wild foods.

Chunk 41:
Chunk 12: In wooded areas, one may encounter edible fungi that grow on trees and decaying wood. Species such as Beefsteak Fungus (Fistulina hepatica) and Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) can be found on oak trees, while Giant Polypore (Meripilus giganteus) grows on beech.

Chunk 42:
Chunk 13: Parks, churchyards, and cemeteries are common locations for mushroom hunting, especially for urban dwellers. These areas typically feature extensive lawns and a variety of trees that support both decomposer and mycorrhizal fungi.

Chunk 43:
Chunk 14: Public spaces generally tolerate mushroom collection, provided that consideration is given to other users. It is advisable to seek permission from landowners or managers before collecting mushrooms.

Chunk 44:
Chunk 15: In parklands, both edible Agaricus species and the slightly poisonous Yellow Stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus) can be found in damp lawns. The Fairy Ring Champignon (Marasmius oreades) also commonly forms fairy rings in these areas.

Chunk 45:
Chunk 16: Historic parklands provide unique opportunities for mushroom hunting, often featuring old trees that support various fungi, including Chicken of the Woods and Hen of the Woods.

Chunk 46:
Chunk 17: Conifer plantations can yield numerous edible decomposing fungi, especially during late autumn. Dark Honey Fungus (Armillaria ostoyae) may be found on roots and stumps, while the needle layer can host fairy rings of Wood Blewit (Lepista nuda).

Chunk 47:
Chunk 18: Common conifers such as spruce, fir, pine, and larch form ectomycorrhizal associations, which can lead to the presence of both mycorrhizal and decomposing fungi in coniferous forests.

Chunk 48:
Chunk 19: Among the mycorrhizal fungi in coniferous forests, various chanterelles (Cantharellus), Crab and Hintapink Brittlegills (Russula xerampelina and Russula paludosa), and orange-milked milkcaps (Lactarius deterrimus) can be found.

Chunk 49:
Chunk 20: In addition to the aforementioned fungi, coniferous forests may also host many boletes and, in regions like Scandinavia, species such as Forest Lamb (Albatrellus ovinus) and The Gypsy (Cortinarius caperatus).

Chunk 50:
Chunk 1: The Common Chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) is one of the best edible mushrooms and can be found in pine plantations as early as July. The Cep (Boletus edulis) can be found in large quantities during the â€˜Cep boomâ€™, which occurs for a few weeks around the 1st of September.

Chunk 51:
Chunk 2: Milkcap mushrooms and chanterelles may grow at the edge of a path through a coniferous forest. A spruce plantation with a mat of brown needle cover is a good place to look for Cep and Wood Blewit mushrooms.

Chunk 52:
Chunk 3: Dead conifer wood can produce honey fungi and Wood Cauliflower. Ectomycorrhizal fungi can be found by looking for trees such as beech, oak, hornbeam, lime, hazel, willow, poplar, and birch. Ash and maple trees do not form ectomycorrhizal associations.

Chunk 53:
Chunk 4: Among the common edible wood-inhabiting fungi are various species of Honey Fungus. In microhabitats with differing nutritional conditions and pH levels, one can find delicious edible species like boletes, brittlegills (Russula), hedgehog fungi (Hydnum), chanterelles (Cantharellus), and Horn of Plenty (Craterellus cornucopioides).

Chunk 54:
Chunk 5: Caution is advised as the deadly poisonous Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) and Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa) can be found in the same habitats.

Chunk 55:
Chunk 6: During summer and autumn, look for Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus) and Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) on old oaks. The Fungus (Armillaria) primarily fruits from roots and stumps in mid-autumn.

Chunk 56:
Chunk 7: Later in the year, the Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) can be hunted on larger trunks of trees such as beech.

Chunk 57:
Chunk 8: Deciduous woodlands are good places to discover edible fungi, which can be both mycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting. Fungi can occur anywhere in a woodland, but the best luck is often found along roadsides, tracks, or on slopes.

Chunk 58:
Chunk 9: In these locations, road material and sliding gravel create mixed soil types, resulting in a variety of fungal habitats. An example is a beech woodland where dead trunks have been allowed to remain, benefiting both edible fungi and Tinder Bracket.

Chunk 59:
Chunk 10: A slope with exposed soil that comprises both acidic and alkaline areas is a place where Deathcap mushrooms can grow. Old grazed oak woods are good locations for finding Chicken of the Woods and Hen of the Woods.

Chunk 60:
Chunk 11: Polypores are more resilient to drought than many other fungi because they can retain water longer than the surrounding soil. Edible fungi can be found throughout autumn, right up until frost destroys the fruit bodies.

Chunk 61:
Chunk 12: During winter, only a few cold-adapted species such as Oyster Mushroom, Velvet Shank (Flammulina velutipes), and Jelly Ear (Auricularia auricula-judae) remain. Most edible fungi form fruit bodies only in moist environments.

Chunk 62:
Chunk 13: There may be a dry period with few visible fungi during summer, but typically about four weeks after the first autumnal rains, fruit bodies appear, starting with decomposer fungi followed by mycorrhizal fungi.

Chunk 63:
Chunk 14: During prolonged drought conditions, polypores can be successfully searched for on large trunks, as rotten wood retains moisture better than other substrates.

Chunk 64:
Chunk 15: Edible fungi can be found almost all year round; however, most species form fruit bodies during autumn. Spring offers rare morels (Morchella) and the more common St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom (Calocybe gambosa).

Chunk 65:
Chunk 16: Early summer brings the first chanterelles (Cantharellus), brittlegills (Russula), and boletes, while autumn provides a wide range of edible mushrooms.

Chunk 66:
Chunk 17: Edible fungi are available throughout the year, with specific species peaking in different months. For example, Black Morel is typically found in March and April, while Chicken of the Woods appears from May to October.

Chunk 67:
Chunk 18: Fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants, which explains why some amino acids that are difficult to obtain from plant diets can be sourced from fungi.

Chunk 68:
Chunk 19: Some fungi also provide Vitamin B12, which is usually obtained from animal products. Overall, mushrooms contain many vitamins and can be a useful supplement to a vegetarian diet.

Chunk 69:
Chunk 20: Traditionally, fungi have been a small component of typical Western European and North American diets. In contrast, wild mushrooms have always been valued in Eastern Europe and are an important source of trade and nutrition in Africa.

Chunk 70:
Chunk 21: In Asia, a wide variety of wild mushrooms are used, and there is a long history of cultivating mushrooms for food and traditional medicine.

Chunk 71:
Chunk 22: Recent research has focused on the medicinal properties of fungi, including the discovery that many antibiotics are derived from certain mushroom species.

Chunk 72:
Chunk 1: Penicillin and other medicinal properties of fungi have garnered significant interest, particularly in relation to micro-fungi. Some edible fungi, especially those prized in Asia, are also being studied for their health benefits.

Chunk 73:
Chunk 2: Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) and cultivated Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) are examples of fungi believed to activate the immune system and potentially exhibit anti-cancer effects.

Chunk 74:
Chunk 3: Other fungi with similar purported health properties include the polypore Turkeytail (Trametes versicolor), Lacquered Bracket (Ganoderma lucidum, known as Reishi), and Jelly Ear (Auricularia auricula-judae).

Chunk 75:
Chunk 4: The nutritional profile of mushrooms is notable; they are low in fat and sugar but high in protein, making them a valuable food source within the fungal kingdom.

Chunk 76:
Chunk 5: Edible mushrooms are characterized by their taste, recognizability, and commonality. Historically, mushrooms have not been widely accepted in Western European cuisine due to fears of toxicity and associations with the supernatural.

Chunk 77:
Chunk 6: In the 20th century, the acceptance of wild fungi as food has increased. Commonly preferred edible mushrooms among Western European collectors include yellow chanterelles, cep group boletes, marzipan-smelling Agaricus species, and morels.

Chunk 78:
Chunk 7: Guidelines for safely consuming mushrooms include ensuring absolute certainty of their identity, using only young and fresh fruit bodies, and being cautious with new species to avoid allergic reactions.

Chunk 79:
Chunk 8: Symbols used to indicate the edibility of mushrooms include classifications such as excellent after proper cooking, acceptable after proper cooking, worthless, poisonous, and deadly poisonous.

Chunk 80:
Chunk 9: Some mushrooms, like the Yellow Stainer and orange-capped boletes in the genus Leccinum, can cause stomach upset in some individuals, while others tolerate them well after cooking.

Chunk 81:
Chunk 10: Neurotoxins in certain mushrooms can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, headache, confusion, and hallucinations, typically manifesting soon after ingestion.

Chunk 82:
Chunk 11: Poisonous mushrooms containing cytotoxins can result in delayed poisoning effects, often affecting the liver and kidneys, with symptoms appearing hours or days after consumption.

Chunk 83:
Chunk 12: The Deathcap and Destroying Angel are examples of dangerously poisonous fungi due to their cytotoxin content, which can lead to severe health consequences.

Chunk 84:
Chunk 13: The gastrointestinal irritants among fungal toxins cause mild symptoms like rumbling, pain, diarrhea, and vomiting shortly after consumption, but are rarely life-threatening.

Chunk 85:
Chunk 14: Fungal toxins can be categorized into four types: gastrointestinal irritants, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, and other toxins, each with varying effects on health.

Chunk 86:
Chunk 15: Folk wisdom often provides misleading advice on identifying edible fungi, such as relying on their appearance, smell, or taste, which can be dangerous.

Chunk 87:
Chunk 16: A comprehensive exploration of edible fungi should also address poisonous varieties that may be confused with safe options. Notable deadly species include False Morel, Deathcap, and Destroying Angel.

Chunk 88:
Chunk 17: In Northern European mushroom literature, additional deadly species often mentioned include Funeral Bell, Splendid Webcap, Deadly Webcap, and Foolâ€™s Webcap, which do not closely resemble the edible fungi discussed.

Chunk 89:
Chunk 18: Less poisonous fungi that can still cause unpleasant effects include Devilâ€™s Bolete, Bilious Bolete, Fly Agaric, Panthercap, Common Inkcap, and Livid Pinkgill.

Chunk 90:
Chunk 19: The Deathcap is notable for its deceptive appearance, being visually appealing and mild in taste, yet it is highly toxic and can be mistaken for safe mushrooms.

Chunk 91:
Chunk 20: It is a common misconception that one must wear gloves to handle poisonous mushrooms. In reality, it is safe to touch poisonous mushrooms, and children should not wear plastic gloves when exploring forests.

Chunk 92:
Chunk 1: The red Fly Agaric is not as poisonous as its reputation suggests. While consuming it may cause sickness, healthy individuals will not die from eating it. This mushroom is protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which prohibits picking and uprooting. Violating this law can result in a hefty fine.

Chunk 93:
Chunk 2: Four species of fungi are currently listed under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, and mushroom hunting is generally accepted. However, uprooting any wild plant, including fungi, without the landowner's permission is illegal. Uprooting is defined as digging up or removing the plant from the land, regardless of whether it has roots.

Chunk 94:
Chunk 3: Non-commercial collecting of mushrooms is generally tolerated, and the 1968 Theft Act specifically excludes non-commercial picking of mushrooms from the definition of stealing. However, some authorities and landowners have enacted bye-laws that reinforce a ban on commercial collecting of fungi without a license.

Chunk 95:
Chunk 4: Fungi play a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems by decaying and recycling nutrients from dead organic matter, supporting plants through mycorrhizal and lichen connections, and providing food for various animals, especially invertebrates. Collectors have a responsibility to gather fungi sustainably, taking only what the environment can withstand.

Chunk 96:
Chunk 5: Foragers must be knowledgeable about fungi to avoid picking threatened or unpalatable species. It is important to collect only specimens that are at a suitable stage for consumption and to leave overmature ones for insects like beetles and fungus gnats.

Chunk 97:
Chunk 6: Collectors should avoid excessive trampling on sensitive wildlife habitats when gathering fungi. This advice applies to all fungus collection, but additional caution is necessary for the 400 scarcer species on the British national Red Data list or those included in UK biodiversity action plans.

Chunk 98:
Chunk 7: The British Mycological Society (BMS) recommends that foraging should be discouraged on land designated for wildlife conservation. The Society emphasizes that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy fungi in their natural habitat without disturbance.

Chunk 99:
Chunk 8: There is currently no Red List of fungi for the island of Ireland. In Britain, some species of fungi are specially protected, and regulations regarding fungus collection vary between administrations within the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Chunk 100:
Chunk 9: Bearded Tooth (Hericium erinaceus) grows on very old beech trees and is protected by the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981, making it illegal to collect. Conifer Roundhead (Stropharia hornemannii) is designated as Critically Endangered on the British Red List and should also not be collected.

Chunk 101:
Chunk 10: When collecting mushrooms, only young, firm, and healthy fruitbodies are suitable for cooking. Many species are prone to infestation by insect larvae, particularly fungus gnats, which can damage the fruitbodies.

Chunk 102:
Chunk 11: It is advisable to cut a fruitbody to check for larvae or other issues before deciding to collect it. Other fungi, such as moulds, can also attack edible fungi, especially boletes, which are particularly susceptible to mould.

Chunk 103:
Chunk 12: Plastic bags should be avoided when transporting collected fungi, as they can crush the fruitbodies and make identification difficult. Proper equipment is essential for mushroom hunting, starting with a knife for picking and cleaning.

Chunk 104:
Chunk 13: A small kitchen knife or a specialized mushroom knife with a brush can be useful for cleaning. It is also important to have a suitable container for transporting the collected mushrooms, such as an open basket or a flat-bottomed paper bag.

Chunk 105:
Chunk 14: Before cooking, mushrooms must be cleaned thoroughly. Dirty stems can contaminate clean fruitbodies, and washing mushrooms in water should be minimized to avoid diluting their flavor.

Chunk 106:
Chunk 15: For mushrooms that tend to become slimy during cooking, such as boletes, it is especially important to limit the use of water. Other species, like Horn of Plenty and Hen of the Woods, are more tolerant of moisture.

Chunk 107:
Chunk 16: The best method for cleaning mushrooms is to remove dirt with a knife or brush and then wash with a little water if necessary. After cleaning, mushrooms should be cut into smaller pieces in preparation for cooking.

Chunk 108:
Chunk 17: When picking mushrooms, you can choose to collect them with or without the basal part and soil. If unsure about the species, it is important to bring the entire fruitbody home for proper identification.

Chunk 109:
Chunk 18: If familiar with the species and collecting for eating, it is acceptable to clean the fruitbodies on-site. The method of harvesting does not significantly affect the underlying mycelium, which is the main part of the fungus.

Chunk 110:
Chunk 19: Certain mushrooms, like the Giant Parasol and Giant Puffball, require breading to enhance their flavor. The Beefsteak Fungus can provide an unusual aesthetic experience when used raw in dishes like sushi.

Chunk 111:
Chunk 20: Many mushroom species offer excellent culinary potential, but some require specific cooking techniques to achieve the best results. For example, frying Cep mushrooms without ending up with a sticky mass is a skill that must be learned.

Chunk 112:
Chunk 1: Species that do not have strong flavors are most enjoyable when mixed with more flavorful species. This is particularly true for species that are only awarded one green dot.

Chunk 113:
Chunk 2: Some mushroom species, such as blewits, have a perfumed taste that can be polarizing; some people enjoy it while others do not. Jelly Ear has a unique cartilaginous texture and can be incorporated into pÃ¢tÃ©s and pies. Garlic Parachute can be used as a substitute for onion.

Chunk 114:
Chunk 3: Certain mushrooms, like morels, chanterelles, Horn of Plenty, hedgehog fungi, Hen of the Woods, and good boletes and milkcaps, have distinct flavors and cooking characteristics.

Chunk 115:
Chunk 4: The category labeled â€˜good taste, firm consistencyâ€™ includes some of the best edible mushrooms, such as morels, Wood Cauliflower, Hen of the Woods, and chanterelles.

Chunk 116:
Chunk 5: There are thousands of mushroom species, but not all are worth picking or cooking. A ranking of edible mushrooms helps identify which species are desirable for culinary use.

Chunk 117:
Chunk 6: The Orange Birch Bolete (Leccinum versipelle) is a valuable dietary supplement on mountain hikes, especially when paired with freeze-dried food.

Chunk 118:
Chunk 7: A good mushroom soup can be made by frying mushrooms and chopped onions in a pot, adding water and stock, and bringing it to a boil. Cream, lemon, and salt can be added for flavor.

Chunk 119:
Chunk 8: If mushrooms are old or have a poor consistency, blending the soup can improve the texture. Many mushroom species are suitable for soup, particularly when they are sandy, as the sand settles at the bottom.

Chunk 120:
Chunk 9: A favorite variation of mushroom soup includes yellowing, marzipan-scented Agaricus species, which adds a unique flavor.

Chunk 121:
Chunk 10: When frying mushrooms, it is important not to overfill the pan. Frying should be done hard and continuously to achieve a crisp texture.

Chunk 122:
Chunk 11: Young boletes are easier to fry, but older specimens should be avoided as they can become problematic. Thinly slicing young Ceps and fast-frying them in hot oil preserves their nut-like raw taste.

Chunk 123:
Chunk 12: A variation of cooking mushrooms involves stirring cooked fungi with boiled pasta. Family members enjoy Wood Cauliflower, Hen of the Woods, or Chicken of the Woods prepared in this manner.

Chunk 124:
Chunk 13: When frying mushrooms, adding olive oil or butter can help achieve a desirable consistency, especially for species like Hen of the Woods that contain little liquid.

Chunk 125:
Chunk 14: Most fungi need to lose up to 80% of their weight in water before they can be properly fried. Boletes can be particularly tricky to cook, as they tend to become slimy.

Chunk 126:
Chunk 15: There are many opinions on edible mushrooms and their preparation methods. Simple cooking techniques are emphasized, while advanced mushroom gastronomy can be explored in specialized cookbooks.

Chunk 127:
Chunk 16: Fried and stewed mushrooms are fundamental recipes for experiencing the basic taste of various edible species. For best results, mushrooms should be cut into centimeter-sized pieces and cooked in a hot, non-stick pan.

Chunk 128:
Chunk 17: Some mushrooms, like Cep and certain Agaricus species, can be consumed raw in salads, but they must be very young and fresh to be palatable.

Chunk 129:
Chunk 18: The young Beefsteak Fungus has a flesh-like structure and can be used in sushi, though its sour taste may require marinating to improve flavor.

Chunk 130:
Chunk 19: The Giant Puffball and Giant Parasol should be coated in breadcrumbs before cooking. The Giant Puffball can be sliced into centimeter-thick pieces, while the Giant Parasol's caps can be used without the stem.

Chunk 131:
Chunk 20: Only a few mushroom species are recommended for raw consumption, including certain boletes and Agaricus species, which can be combined with other strong ingredients.

Chunk 132:
Chunk 21: Mushrooms can be used in pies or as toppings for pizza. Species that soften during cooking are particularly suitable for pies.

Chunk 133:
Chunk 22: To make a pie, a pastry dough can be prepared by mixing water, olive oil, and flour. After resting, the dough is rolled out and pre-baked until light brown.

Chunk 134:
Chunk 23: Mushrooms should be fried until they release their water before being placed in the pie. Additional ingredients like onions and garlic can enhance the filling.

Chunk 135:
Chunk 24: The filling for the pie can be completed by mixing eggs and milk, pouring it over the mushrooms, and baking until the surface is golden brown.

Chunk 136:
Chunk 25: Suitable mushrooms for pies include Horn of Plenty, Trumpet Chanterelle, boletes, and Shaggy Inkcap.

Chunk 137:
Chunk 26: Freezing is an effective method for preserving mushrooms. Some species, like Cep, can be frozen raw after being cleaned and cut into cubes.

Chunk 138:
Chunk 27: For other mushroom species, pre-frying before freezing can be beneficial. Fry the mushrooms until the water is boiled away, but delay browning until the dish is prepared.

Chunk 139:
Chunk 28: Pre-frying mushrooms before freezing allows them to shrink significantly, saving space in the freezer.

Chunk 140:
Chunk 29: Salting mushrooms is a preservation method commonly used in Eastern Europe.

Chunk 141:
Chunk 1: An advantage of salting is that it can remove the hot taste from bearded milkcaps. In Eastern Europe, bearded milkcaps are prized edible mushrooms.

Chunk 142:
Chunk 2: To prepare bearded milkcaps for salting, clean the mushrooms and soak them for a few minutes in boiling water. After soaking, drain the mushrooms and let them cool.

Chunk 143:
Chunk 3: Once cooled, place the mushrooms between layers of coarse salt in a washed and scalded jar. Press the pieces down with something heavy, such as a stone in a clean plastic bag.

Chunk 144:
Chunk 4: The salt will quickly extract the water from the mushrooms, resulting in the fungi being covered in brine. After a few weeks, the mushrooms are ready for use but need to be desalinated in cold water for a few hours before consumption.

Chunk 145:
Chunk 5: When foraging, one may find an abundance of edible mushrooms that cannot all be consumed immediately. Drying mushrooms is an effective storage method.

Chunk 146:
Chunk 6: Mushrooms can be dried by spreading a thin layer on a table on a sunny day or on a wire mesh over a radiator. The most efficient method is to use a food dehydrator.

Chunk 147:
Chunk 7: In a food dehydrator, mushrooms are placed in narrow trays that can be stacked above a heat source. For efficient drying, it is important that the fruit bodies are not thick and fleshy.

Chunk 148:
Chunk 8: Thin-fleshed mushrooms, such as Horn of Plenty and Trumpet Chanterelles, can be placed directly in the dehydrator. More solid mushrooms must be sliced to facilitate water evaporation.

Chunk 149:
Chunk 9: When dried mushrooms are stored in jars and sealed properly, they can last for years. To prepare dried mushrooms for cooking, soak them in water for an hour.

Chunk 150:
Chunk 10: Large boletes that tend to become slimy during frying may be much easier to prepare after drying.

Chunk 151:
Chunk 11: Fungi play a significant role in biotechnology, particularly as biofactories for producing enzymes and medicines. Yeast fungi can be engineered to produce desired proteins or enzymes.

Chunk 152:
Chunk 12: Fungi also have healing properties. Wild edible fungi, such as Hen of the Woods, have been used in Asian medicine to strengthen the immune system.

Chunk 153:
Chunk 13: Since World War II, fungi have played a major role in Western medicine, particularly in the production of antibiotics from moulds of the genus Penicillium.

Chunk 154:
Chunk 14: The genetic code for antibiotics can be engineered into yeast fungi, which then produce the desired substances in fermentation tanks.

Chunk 155:
Chunk 15: Fungi have developed a large spectrum of enzymes to release nutrients. These enzymes can be used in various applications, including washing powders or converting straw into biofuel.

Chunk 156:
Chunk 16: Fungi are useful for much more than culinary purposes; they are involved in industrial applications such as alcohol production and as raising agents for bread.

Chunk 157:
Chunk 17: Alcohol, or ethanol, is formed by fermentation, where yeasts convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide in an oxygen-free environment.

Chunk 158:
Chunk 18: The carbon dioxide produced during fermentation bubbles away, while the alcohol remains in the liquid, which can be transformed into beverages like wine and beer.

Chunk 159:
Chunk 19: If a fermentation bottle is closed before the process stops, the carbon dioxide creates a sparkling drink, such as beer or champagne.

Chunk 160:
Chunk 20: The same fermentation process is used in bread-making, where carbon dioxide forms bubbles in the dough, while alcohol is a waste product.

Chunk 161:
Chunk 21: Fungi can produce strong and vibrant colors, which can be used for dyeing yarn. The reason for these colors in fungi is still a mystery.

Chunk 162:
Chunk 22: Many fungal dyes are unstable and can disappear when dried or heated, but some species contain stable dyes that can bind to yarn.

Chunk 163:
Chunk 23: For example, the Surprise Webcap produces a splendid orange-red color, while the Cinnamon Bracket can yield rare purple hues.

Chunk 164:
Chunk 24: The hymenophore is the area on the underside of a mushroom cap where spores form. This area is well-protected from environmental factors.

Chunk 165:
Chunk 25: In many fungal species, the hymenophore has developed folded structures that increase the surface area for spore production, such as gills, spikes, and pores.

Chunk 166:
Chunk 26: Identifying the hymenophore of a fungus can aid in species identification. Fungi can produce spores in various locations, not just the cap and stem.

Chunk 167:
Chunk 27: The purpose of fungal fruit bodies is to facilitate sexual reproduction and produce spores that help disperse the fungus.

Chunk 168:
Chunk 28: Fungal fruit bodies appear fleshy but are formed by tubular fungal hyphae that are woven together, similar to interwoven yarn.

Chunk 169:
Chunk 29: To identify an agaric mushroom, knowing the color of its spores is important. However, spores are too small to see with the naked eye.

Chunk 170:
Chunk 30: To determine the color of spores, one must look at a spore deposit, which provides a clearer indication of the spore color.

Chunk 171:
Chunk 1: A good lens can be used to examine the gills of fungi or to search at the top of the stem for small spore deposits found in wrinkles and remnants of the veil. When fungi grow in an overlapping fashion, spore deposits may also be present on the upper side of the lower caps. If no spore deposits are found, one can create a spore deposit manually.

Chunk 172:
Chunk 2: All edible mushrooms, except for morels, belong to the group of fungi called Basidiomycota. In these fungi, spores are typically formed in groups of four at the top of a cell known as a basidium. The basidia are located on the hymenophore, which can be found on gills, spines, or within tubes and pores.

Chunk 173:
Chunk 3: To create a spore deposit, take a fresh mushroom cap and cut off the stem. Place the cap with the gills facing down on a piece of white paper and cover it with a bowl or plastic to prevent drying. If the fungus is fresh and alive, it will usually release spores onto the paper within 2 to 4 hours.

Chunk 174:
Chunk 4: The Weeping Widow (Lacrymaria lacrymabunda) produces a black spore color, which is revealed by the thousands of spores trapped in the veil remnants. A close examination of the gills shows both white (immature) and black (mature) spores sitting in groups of four at the top of the basidia.

Chunk 175:
Chunk 5: The Semifree Morel (Morchella semilibera) is a small, thin-fleshed morel characterized by a margin around the lower part of the head that is free of the stem. It resembles the Common Morel and is a good edible mushroom, but it must not be consumed raw. This species is typically found in areas affected by human activity, such as locations with limy deposits brought to the surface.

Chunk 176:
Chunk 6: The Common Morel (Morchella esculenta) is considered the culinary best among morels. It has a distinctive appearance and a powerful taste that is enhanced by lemon. This mushroom should not be eaten raw and is highly variable in shape and color. It typically grows in alkaline soils, particularly on chalk or limestone.

Chunk 177:
Chunk 7: Morels are spring fungi that produce large, club-shaped fruitbodies with a honeycomb-like exterior. The entire fruitbody is hollow. False Morels differ from true morels in that their heads are not hollow but folded throughout.

Chunk 178:
Chunk 8: The False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is distantly related to true morels and resembles them closely. The key difference is that the head of the False Morel does not have a large internal cavity and is instead folded in a brain-like manner. It is highly toxic when raw, but most toxins are eliminated through drying or cooking, although some residues remain.

Chunk 179:
Chunk 9: The White Saddle (Helvella crispa) is another distant relative of morels, characterized by a pitted or furrowed stem and a folded, saddle-shaped head. All parts of the White Saddle are whitish, and it typically grows in humid hardwood forest soils, especially along roadsides. It is not poisonous but is not considered edible.

Chunk 180:
Chunk 10: The Black Morel (Morchella elata) is less fleshy than the Common Morel and has an elongated, pointed top with longitudinal ribs. It is a decomposer and can often be found in disturbed soil areas, such as flower beds. Black Morel is as tasty as the Common Morel, but it must not be eaten raw.

Chunk 181:
Chunk 11: The fruitbodies of morels can be large and remain fresh for an extended period in the refrigerator. One fruitbody can suffice for multiple meals due to its fine taste and crisp texture. However, it is advisable to avoid old, brownish specimens, as they may have a bitter taste.

Chunk 182:
Chunk 12: Wood Cauliflower is found in conifer plantations, particularly with spruce or pine, and typically forms fruitbodies at the base of trees, often between two roots. This fungus can be found throughout autumn. The Upright Coral (Ramaria stricta) produces medium-sized, branched fruitbodies that are orange to light brown and grow from twigs and branches of beech trees.

Chunk 183:
Chunk 1: Unlike Wood Cauliflower, Upright Coral has branches that are largely round in cross-section and exhibit an upright branching pattern. Although Upright Coral can be one of the most common fungi found in autumn beech woods, it is of no value as an edible fungus.

Chunk 184:
Chunk 2: There are many other species of coral fungi, some of which are edible. However, these species look very much alike and should be approached with caution to avoid misidentification.

Chunk 185:
Chunk 3: Coral Tooth (Hericium coralloides) forms coral-like branched fruitbodies with white branches that are clad with long, downward-pointing spines. This fungus grows on old beeches and is mostly observed late in autumn.

Chunk 186:
Chunk 4: Coral Tooth is edible, but it is considered rare and is registered as Near Threatened on the British Red Data list. Therefore, it is recommended to leave Coral Tooth in its natural habitat to enhance the beauty of the woodland scene.

Chunk 187:
Chunk 5: Wood Cauliflower (Sparassis crispa) grows on conifers and can produce fruitbodies as large as a football. These fruitbodies consist of curly, flat, beige-colored lobes.

Chunk 188:
Chunk 6: The flesh of Wood Cauliflower often has a slight chemical odor that dissipates during cooking. Other similar fungi include Upright Coral, which can have a similar color to Wood Cauliflower but grows on hardwood, and Coral Tooth, which forms large, branched, white fruitbodies lined with spines.

Chunk 189:
Chunk 7: Dryadâ€™s Saddle (Cerioporus squamosus) produces very large, rather soft-fleshed fruitbodies that are attached to trees with a short, dark stem. The upper side of Dryadâ€™s Saddle has coarse scales, and the pores are several millimeters wide.

Chunk 190:
Chunk 8: Dryadâ€™s Saddle is commonly found on old deciduous trees, particularly in parks and gardens. It typically forms fruitbodies during May and June, but may also be found later in the year.

Chunk 191:
Chunk 9: Young specimens of Dryadâ€™s Saddle are edible and have a scent reminiscent of cucumber or watermelon. However, the stem and mature fruitbodies are tough and not suitable for consumption.

Chunk 192:
Chunk 10: Dryadâ€™s Saddle is not considered one of the top edible fungi, but it has recently gained popularity in gourmet restaurants as part of the New Nordic Cuisine movement.

Chunk 193:
Chunk 11: Polypores form fruitbodies where the underside is covered in small holes known as pores. The lining of the pores produces spores that disperse into the air when they drop out of the pore mouth.

Chunk 194:
Chunk 12: Polypores primarily grow on wood, and their fruitbodies can vary in size from small to enormous. Some species may develop perennial fruitbodies that are as hard as wood, while the edible polypore species are generally soft-fleshed and have a stem or narrowed base.

Chunk 195:
Chunk 13: Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus) is a very large, orange-yellow polypore that forms magnificent tiered clusters on living trees. It is most commonly found on oak but can also grow on various other deciduous trees.

Chunk 196:
Chunk 14: Chicken of the Woods has a mild taste and a firm consistency that is similar to chicken meat. Specimens that grow on oak may taste more sour than those found on other deciduous trees.

Chunk 197:
Chunk 15: Young Chicken of the Woods, where the pores are not yet fully developed, are edible after thorough cooking. It is important to cut them into thin slices or small cubes and fry them, ensuring that the pieces are heated all the way through to avoid an upset stomach.

Chunk 198:
Chunk 16: Umbrella Polypore (Cladomeris umbellatus) resembles Hen of the Woods but has small caps attached by a central stem. It grows on the ground near old beeches and is occasionally found near oaks.

Chunk 199:
Chunk 17: Umbrella Polypore is edible but is considered less tasty and much softer than Hen of the Woods. It is also often affected by insect larvae and typically fruits from July to September.

Chunk 200:
Chunk 18: Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) forms large, tiered fruitbodies with many small caps resembling small tongues attached by a stalk. The pore surface of Hen of the Woods is white, and the pores are quite large.

Chunk 201:
Chunk 19: Hen of the Woods typically grows on old oaks and emerges in gaps between two roots during autumn. It is an excellent edible fungus with a fine consistency and is more flavorful than other edible polypores.

Chunk 202:
Chunk 20: Giant Polypore (Meripilus giganteus) is a striking fungus that forms gigantic, tiered, brown fruitbodies at the base of beech trees. Its beige-colored pore surface darkens when touched.

Chunk 203:
Chunk 21: Giant Polypore grows on old beeches in urban and suburban landscapes, such as parks and cemeteries, and it decomposes the wood, which can eventually lead to the death of the tree.

Chunk 204:
Chunk 22: The fruitbodies of Giant Polypore typically appear in August and early September. Although it is not poisonous, its somewhat sour and slightly perfumed taste may not meet the expectations of many mushroom hunters.

Chunk 205:
Chunk 1: Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) is an edible mushroom that has similar coloration to other fungi but is smaller in size. Unlike some other mushrooms, it does not turn dark when touched and typically grows on oak trees.

Chunk 206:
Chunk 2: Young specimens of Hen of the Woods can be enjoyed in various culinary applications, including salads and pickles. One of the most spectacular uses of this mushroom is in Nigiri sushi, where it can add a unique flavor to the dish.

Chunk 207:
Chunk 3: Beefsteak Fungus (Fistulina hepatica) is another edible fungus characterized by its peculiar, tongue-shaped fruitbodies filled with red juice. When cut, it reveals a juicy, structured flesh that resembles the texture of raw tongue.

Chunk 208:
Chunk 4: The underside of Beefsteak Fungus is covered with small tubes. In young specimens, these tubes are fused together with closed mouths, but as the fungus matures, the pores become free and open tubes. This fungus typically appears in August or September and grows exclusively on old oak trees.

Chunk 209:
Chunk 5: Fused Polypore (Albatrellus confluens) is a fungus that resembles Forest Lamb but has a somewhat browner cap and does not change color when touched. This fungus has a bitter taste and should not be mixed with edible fungi, although it is likely not poisonous.

Chunk 210:
Chunk 6: Forest Lamb (Albatrellus ovinus) is a polypore that grows on the ground, particularly in old conifer forests. Its fruitbodies resemble pale boletes and feature a pore layer that extends down the stem. The cap is very pale brown, and the pore mouths change color to pale yellow when touched.

Chunk 211:
Chunk 7: When fried, all parts of Forest Lamb turn yellow. It is important to only collect young specimens and ensure they are thoroughly cooked before consumption. This mushroom is known to have a fine taste and delicate consistency when well-fried.

Chunk 212:
Chunk 8: There are other fungi similar to Forest Lamb. Fused Polypore, which is not found in Britain and Ireland, has a browner cap and does not turn yellow when touched or fried. Additionally, various species of Falsebolete (Boletopsis) have a more greyish color and a bitter taste, although they are not poisonous.

Chunk 213:
Chunk 9: Dryadâ€™s Saddle and similar polypores also have a cap and stem, but their flesh is tough and inseparable from the pores. These fungi primarily grow on wood. In contrast, Forest Lamb has soft flesh and a bolete-like shape, growing on the ground.

Chunk 214:
Chunk 10: Boletes are characterized by their soft-fleshed fruitbodies, which have a cap and stem. Beneath the cap, there is a layer of small tubes where spores are formed. These tubes can usually be separated from each other and from the cap flesh, making boletes easy to recognize.

Chunk 215:
Chunk 11: Most boletes are edible, with some notable exceptions that are moderately poisonous or have a bitter taste. The majority of boletes are safe to consume, and species like Cep, Scarletina Bolete, and Lurid Bolete are considered among the best edible mushrooms.

Chunk 216:
Chunk 12: Boletes contain a lot of water, which can make them somewhat slimy. To properly fry boletes and retain their structure, it is recommended to only pick young, firm fruitbodies. When cooking, place a single layer of mushrooms in the pan and cook over high heat to allow the liquid to evaporate.

Chunk 217:
Chunk 13: A variation for preparing boletes involves slicing young Ceps thinly and fast-frying them in very hot oil. This method helps to retain their nut-like raw taste while minimizing shrinkage. However, only a few slices can be processed at once, which may prolong preparation time.

Chunk 218:
Chunk 14: Boletes can be dried or frozen for later use. When drying, it is essential to cut the mushrooms into thin slices to facilitate the process. Dried boletes become easier to use in cooking as they lose some of their sliminess.

Chunk 219:
Chunk 15: Freezing boletes is also a suitable option. They can be frozen raw as small cubes or cooked to remove excess water before freezing, which helps save space in storage.

Chunk 220:
Chunk 16: The main species of the bolete group is Cep (Boletus edulis), also known as Penny Bun. It is identifiable by its greasy cap surface and tough, jelly-like cap cuticle. Cep is commonly found in various woodlands, particularly under beech, spruce, pine, and fir trees, throughout autumn.

Chunk 221:
Chunk 17: Another fairly common species is Summer Bolete (Boletus reticulatus), which features a paler cap than Cep and a dry, matt cap cuticle. This species prefers open landscapes, such as parks, and is typically found with beech and oak trees during the summer months.

Chunk 222:
Chunk 18: Bitter Bolete (Tylopilus felleus) bears a resemblance to Cep but is inedible due to its unpleasant taste. It is important to distinguish this species from other edible boletes.

Chunk 223:
Chunk 1: Bitter Bolete can be identified by its white tubes that turn pink with age, the dark net ornamentation of the stem, and its very bitter taste. Although it is not poisonous, a single fruitbody can taint an entire dish. This mushroom is quite common in August and September and grows in association with both deciduous and coniferous trees.

Chunk 224:
Chunk 2: Boletes that have white tube mouths and turn yellow as they mature belong to the cep group. These mushrooms have pale net-like ornamentation down the stem and are all edible and of good quality.

Chunk 225:
Chunk 3: Fungi in the bolete genus Leccinum can be recognized by their long, scaly stems and tubes that remain whitish to greyish. Forest Lamb (Albatrellus ovinus) has white tubes that cannot easily be detached from the cap, and it is rarely found in Britain and Ireland but is more common in Scandinavian coniferous forests.

Chunk 226:
Chunk 4: Species of the cep group of boletes form large fruitbodies with a club-shaped stem and a rounded cap, resembling a bun. These mushrooms never turn blue when touched or cut. The best time to look for members of this group is from the end of August to the beginning of September, although the timing may vary based on the dryness of the summer.

Chunk 227:
Chunk 5: The cep boom occurs when these mushrooms may fruit in a concentrated period of two to three weeks. Ceps can still be found later in autumn, but they are usually more scattered by that time. Young specimens should be collected when they are shaped like champagne corks, as they are among the best edible mushrooms.

Chunk 228:
Chunk 6: As soon as the tubes of cep mushrooms start to turn yellow, they become soft and less desirable. If using middle-aged fruitbodies with yellow tubes, it is recommended to remove the tubes before cooking to prevent the dish from becoming very sticky. Old fruitbodies should be avoided.

Chunk 229:
Chunk 7: Species of the cep group establish mycorrhizal associations with various trees, including beech, oak, birch, spruce, pine, and fir. To distinguish between species, knowledge of the host tree and careful examination of the cap cuticle details are necessary. Fortunately, all species within this group are equally tasty.

Chunk 230:
Chunk 8: Rusty Bolete (Xerocomus ferrugineus) can be recognized by its felted cap, which resembles suede, and its coarse, bright yellow tube mouths that usually do not turn blue when bruised. This species is part of a group of soft-fleshed boletes and should only be used alongside more flavorful and firm-fleshed fungi. It grows in both deciduous and coniferous forests.

Chunk 231:
Chunk 9: Small to medium-sized boletes with yellow tube mouths often lack well-defined net ornamentation on their stems. This group has no poisonous members, but several species are bitter-tasting and soft-fleshed, making them best suited as a supplement to fungi with a firmer texture.

Chunk 232:
Chunk 10: Bay Bolete (Imleria badia) is a medium-sized bolete characterized by its brown, smooth stem and yellow tubes. The cap initially has a felted texture but becomes sticky in warm, humid conditions. The tube mouths are small and turn blue a few seconds after being bruised. This mushroom can be found growing with both deciduous and coniferous trees, but it is most common in spruce forests.

Chunk 233:
Chunk 11: Two inedible bitter boletes with yellow tubes are Bitter Beech Bolete and Rooting Bolete. Bitter Beech Bolete (Caloboletus calopus) has pale-capped fruitbodies with pale yellow tube mouths and a stem featuring beautiful net ornamentation that transitions from yellow at the top to red at the base. This species turns blue when wounded and has a very bitter taste.

Chunk 234:
Chunk 12: Rooting Bolete (Caloboletus radicans) forms large fruitbodies with pale caps and pale yellow tubes and stem. Its stem has a very fine, yellow net ornamentation that can be hard to see without a lens. The flesh and tube mouths turn blue when bruised, and this mushroom is also bitter in taste. Rooting Bolete is typically found near deciduous trees in warm parks and cemeteries, fruiting mostly in August and early September.

Chunk 235:
Chunk 13: Several similar but mild-tasting species belong to the genus Butyriboletus, including the rare Pale Bolete (Butyriboletus fechtneri) and Oak Bolete (Butyriboletus appendiculatus). All of these species are edible.

Chunk 236:
Chunk 14: The genus Xerocomellus contains small boletes with stems 1â€“2 cm thick and yellow tube mouths, lacking well-developed net ornamentation. These species are difficult to differentiate and are considered moderately good edible mushrooms, best used as a supplement to other fungi.

Chunk 237:
Chunk 15: Red Cracking Bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) produces small, soft-fleshed fruitbodies with a red-dotted stem, pale yellow tube mouths, and a brown, cracking cap. It grows with beech and conifers, primarily found from August to September.

Chunk 238:
Chunk 16: Matt Bolete (Xerocomellus pruinatus) is extremely similar to Red Cracking Bolete but typically fruits later in the season, during September and October. Its cap shows fewer cracks and often has a narrow red zone along the margin. Young specimens may have a dew-like cap surface.

Chunk 239:
Chunk 17: The genera Suillellus and Neobolete include moderately large boletes with red tube mouths that change color from yellow to indigo blue when cut or bruised. All species in these genera are edible but should only be consumed after cooking, as eating them raw may lead to poisoning, resulting in dizziness and stomach upset.

Chunk 240:
Chunk 18: Devilâ€™s Bolete has a light grey cap and reacts moderately light blue when cut. Bilious Bolete has a pale cap with distinct pink hues and also turns moderately light blue when cut. Peppery Bolete is smaller, with yellow flesh that does not turn blue.

Chunk 241:
Chunk 1: Scarletina Bolete (Neoboletus erythropus) forms large, firm fruitbodies and is an excellent edible fungus, but it must be cooked before consumption. The cap of this mushroom is brown or yellow-brown, and it is distinguished from similar boletes by its stem surface, which lacks net ornamentation and is instead covered with small, orange-red dots. This species is commonly found in deciduous and coniferous woods on slightly poor soils, with a peak occurrence in August and September.

Chunk 242:
Chunk 2: Devilâ€™s Bolete (Rubroboletus satanas) is a large bolete characterized by a pale grey to beige cap and red tube mouths. It has a thick, club-shaped stem with yellow net ornamentation at the top that transitions to a rose-pink color lower down. The surface where the tubes connect to the cap is yellow, and the flesh of the mushroom turns moderately blue when cut. While the taste is mild, the smell is strong, sweet, and often described as nauseating, reminiscent of pig dung. Devilâ€™s Bolete is rare and typically grows in warm areas on rich soils with beech, oak, and lime, often found in parks, gardens, and open woodlands in southern Britain and Ireland. This species is known to cause severe poisonings, leading to vomiting and diarrhea.

Chunk 243:
Chunk 3: Bilious Bolete (Rubroboletus legaliae) is another large bolete featuring orange net ornamentation on its stem. The cap is pale with minimal brown and typically exhibits pinkish shades, especially near the margin. The surface where the tubes adhere to the cap is yellow, and the flesh turns moderately blue when cut. Unlike Devilâ€™s Bolete, Bilious Bolete does not have an unpleasant odor. This species is very rare and is found in warm areas on clay soils with beech. It is believed to cause poisoning, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea.

Chunk 244:
Chunk 4: Lurid Bolete (Suillellus luridus) produces large fruitbodies with a light brown cap and a thick stem adorned with orange net ornamentation. All parts of this mushroom turn blue quickly and vigorously upon handling. A distinctive feature is the red surface where the yellow tubes are attached to the cap flesh. Lurid Bolete is considered one of the best edible mushrooms, but it must never be consumed raw, as it can lead to dizziness and stomach upset. This species is relatively common on clay soils in warm parks, churchyards, and cemeteries during late summer and early autumn, growing alongside deciduous trees such as beech, lime, birch, and oak.

Chunk 245:
Chunk 5: To avoid confusion with Devilâ€™s Bolete and Bilious Bolete, it is important to ensure that Lurid Bolete has a predominantly brown cap and that the surface where the tube layer attaches to the flesh is red. The two poisonous species do not exhibit this red surface. In Devilâ€™s Bolete, there is no red color where the tubes adhere to the cap, while Lurid Bolete showcases a thin, dark line in section, indicating the red surface where the yellow tubes with red mouths connect to the cap.

Chunk 246:
Chunk 6: Orange Birch Bolete (Leccinum versipelle) is part of a group of orange-capped species whose flesh darkens to grey when cut. This mushroom grows in association with birch trees and is somewhat rarer than its brown-capped counterpart. A closely related species, Orange Bolete (Leccinum aurantiacum), is typically found scattered among oak and poplar trees. Orange Birch Bolete and similar species have firm flesh and are considered to have a better taste than the brown species of Leccinum. However, they contain toxic substances that can cause stomach upset if consumed raw. When thoroughly cooked, they are regarded as good edible mushrooms, but some individuals still report stomach issues, so it is advisable to approach with caution.

Chunk 247:
Chunk 7: The boletes in the genus Leccinum are identifiable by their long stems covered in fine scales, which are usually dark and easily visible. All species within this genus are considered edible after thorough cooking, although some people may experience stomach upset from the orange species. Brown Birch Bolete (Leccinum scabrum) is the most common species in this genus, featuring a brown cap and flesh that either remains unchanged or turns slightly orange-red when cut. Leccinum species are often closely associated with specific host trees; for instance, Brown Birch Bolete exclusively grows with birch. There are six similar brownish Leccinum species, many of which exhibit bluish or greenish discoloration at the stem base when bruised or cut. While Brown Birch Bolete and its brown-capped relatives are generally soft-fleshed and not highly regarded as edible fungi, young specimens can be used as a supplement to other mushrooms.

Chunk 248:
Chunk 8: Larch Bolete (Suillus grevillei) forms medium-sized fruitbodies characterized by orange-brown caps and a small, slimy ring. This species exclusively grows with larch and is among the most common boletes found in gardens, fruiting throughout autumn. Although it has somewhat softer flesh than Slippery Jack, Larch Bolete is not highly regarded as an edible mushroom. However, young specimens, once the slime is removed, may be used as a supplement to other mushrooms.

Chunk 249:
Chunk 9: Velvet Bolete (Suillus variegatus) is a species of Suillus that lacks a ring. Its cap is initially felted when young but becomes scaly and is covered with a very thin layer of slime as it matures. The tube mouths of Velvet Bolete have a distinctive greyish-yellow color. This mushroom is considered a moderately good edible fungus and is commonly found with pine trees throughout the autumn.

Chunk 250:
Chunk 10: Peppery Bolete (Chalciporus piperatus) resembles a Suillus but features large, brownish-orange tubes, yellow flesh, and a slightly hot, peppery taste. Although it is not poisonous, it is typically not considered edible due to its flavor. This species fruits from August to October and is often found in spruce forests, though it is likely not directly associated with the trees but rather acts as a parasite of the mycelium of Fly Agaric.

Chunk 251:
Chunk 11: Slippery Jack (Suillus luteus) is recognized as the best edible species within the Suillus genus. It produces medium-sized fruitbodies with a dark brown, very slimy cap, pale yellow tubes, and a large, slimy ring on the stem. Slippery Jack grows in association with pine trees. The slimy boletes in the Suillus genus are initially enveloped in a slimy universal veil, and as they mature, the cap expands while retaining slime on the surface and at the base of the stem. Some species also maintain a slimy ring. All Suillus species grow with conifers and are considered edible.

Chunk 252:
Chunk 12: Slimy boletes with a ring can hardly be confused with other fungi. In contrast, slimy boletes without a ring, such as Velvet Bolete, can be identified by their unique features. The slimy boletes are generally soft-fleshed, and this, combined with their sliminess, makes them less appealing for consumption.

Chunk 253:
Chunk 1: It is especially important to collect very young, firm fruitbodies and pull the slime layer from the cap with a knife. Young fruitbodies of Slippery Jack boletes are wrapped in a slimy veil.

Chunk 254:
Chunk 2: There are slender, deep brown-orange types within the Wood Hedgehog species complex. These mushrooms are just as good for eating as the pale and more fleshy versions.

Chunk 255:
Chunk 3: Scaly Tooth (Sarcodon squamosus) and other species of Sarcodon are usually brown and often very scaly. They have rather soft flesh, which makes them look inviting, but they often have a bitter and unpleasant taste.

Chunk 256:
Chunk 4: Within the group of Sarcodon, there are several very similar species that are difficult to distinguish. Some of these species are rare, so it is advisable to leave them in their habitats rather than collect them.

Chunk 257:
Chunk 5: Orange Tooth (Hydnellum aurantiacum) and other species of Hydnellum have brown, orange, or bluish colors and are often tough. While none of these species are known to be poisonous, Devilâ€™s Tooth (Hydnellum peckii) has a very unpleasant bitter taste.

Chunk 258:
Chunk 6: Wood Hedgehog (Hydnum repandum) forms relatively large, soft-fleshed fruitbodies. The cap color is difficult to describe, but the margin can be almost white, while the middle is often pinkish-yellow to yellowish-orange.

Chunk 259:
Chunk 7: The flesh and surface of Wood Hedgehog often become darker orange-brown when bruised, and it may emit a sour or fishy smell. The fruitbodies may emit almost urine-like odors during frying, but well-done Wood Hedgehog is an excellent edible mushroom.

Chunk 260:
Chunk 8: Wood Hedgehog forms mycorrhizal associations with deciduous trees and typically fruits from August to October. This species is actually a complex of more than ten similar but poorly understood species, making it difficult to provide an exact description of its habitat.

Chunk 261:
Chunk 9: Some types of Wood Hedgehog are found in beech woods on clay soils, while others can be very common on poor soils with beech or conifers. Tooth fungi have a stem and a cap, but unlike many mushrooms, the underside of the cap is covered with small teeth or spines.

Chunk 262:
Chunk 10: The edible species of tooth fungi belong to the genus of hedgehog mushrooms (Hydnum). These mushrooms are all soft-fleshed, and their caps can be whitish, light yellow-orange, or brownish-orange. They form mycorrhiza and grow on the ground in woodlands.

Chunk 263:
Chunk 11: There are several other genera of fungi with teeth or spines underneath. While these fungi are inedible, none are poisonous. Sticking to the soft-fleshed species with whitish, yellow-orange, or brownish-orange colors ensures safety.

Chunk 264:
Chunk 12: Orange Tooth is tough, while Scaly Tooth is soft-fleshed and often has a bitter taste. False Chanterelle (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) resembles yellow chanterelles but has true gills that are regularly forked.

Chunk 265:
Chunk 13: Funnels may be shaped like chanterelles but have whitish true gills. Some funnel species are poisonous. Rollrims are funnel-shaped but have normal, brown gills that darken when touched, and they are poisonous.

Chunk 266:
Chunk 14: Pigâ€™s Ear (Gomphus clavatus) is large and fleshy with a chanterelle shape and branched veins on the underside. When young, it is violet, but as it ages, it becomes more brownish. This fungus is a good edible variety but is extremely rare, possibly extinct in Britain.

Chunk 267:
Chunk 15: Rollrims (Paxillus) form large, brown fruitbodies with the edge of the cap rolled under, a finely downy edge, and decurrent gills. When bruised, the pale brown gills change to dark brown.

Chunk 268:
Chunk 16: Some species of Rollrim grow on poor soil with conifers, while others prefer clay soils with lime. Rollrims have a unique poisonous effect; they may be initially edible, but repeated consumption can lead to an allergic reaction.

Chunk 269:
Chunk 17: Funnels (Clitocybe and Infundibulicybe) have funnel-shaped fruitbodies that can vary in size. They possess normal, unbranched, whitish gills and can be found in both woods and open land. Some funnel species are edible, but certain small, whitish funnels growing on grassland are very poisonous.

Chunk 270:
Chunk 18: Chanterelles are funnel-shaped or cone-shaped with a solid or hollow stem. The outside or underside of the cap displays irregularly branched veins, and they grow on the ground, forming mycorrhizal associations with trees.

Chunk 271:
Chunk 19: All chanterelles are edible and are among the best edible mushrooms. Unlike many mushrooms that have a generic taste, chanterelles have a very characteristic flavor, and they retain a pleasant crispiness when fried.

Chunk 272:
Chunk 20: Common Chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) forms mycorrhizal associations with a wide variety of trees, especially preferring spruce, pine, and beech on poorer soils. They can be found during summer and autumn, often alongside roads and tracks in spruce or pine plantations.

Chunk 273:
Chunk 21: False Chanterelle (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) resembles a thin-fleshed and very orange Common Chanterelle but is more closely related to the boletes. The underside of False Chanterelle fruitbodies is lined with regularly forked gills.

Chunk 274:
Chunk 22: False Chanterelle grows as a decomposer on the ground and on wood, fruiting during autumn in coniferous forests. It is generally considered edible but may cause stomach upsets due to its tasteless flesh.

Chunk 275:
Chunk 23: Pale Chanterelle (Cantharellus pallens) is similar to Common Chanterelle but has thicker, larger, and more fleshy fruitbodies. The color is somewhat paler, turning brown-orange when bruised, and it has a very fine taste and structure.

Chunk 276:
Chunk 24: The yellow chanterelles form solid, apricot-yellow fruitbodies with irregularly branched veins running from the cap margin down the stem. They form mycorrhizal associations and grow on the ground, typically being small in size.

Chunk 277:
Chunk 25: The aroma of yellow chanterelles is pleasant and sweet, but their raw flesh tastes peppery, making them inedible in raw form. Yellow chanterelles are among the best edible mushrooms and are a treat when stewed and served on toast.

Chunk 278:
Chunk 1: Other similar fungi include the False Chanterelle, which is soft-fleshed and has true gills with a regularly forked branching pattern. The underside of the Common Chanterelle is covered by branched veins.

Chunk 279:
Chunk 2: The Common Chanterelle can be found on the forest floor of conifer forests. In Norway or Sweden, there is a good chance of finding the Golden Chanterelle, which prefers calcareous soils and forms mycorrhizal associations with conifers.

Chunk 280:
Chunk 3: Golden Chanterelle (Craterellus lutescens) is very similar to Trumpet Chanterelle but has only very shallow wrinkles under the cap. It is a fine edible fungus, although it is very rare in Britain and Ireland.

Chunk 281:
Chunk 4: The Jellybaby (Leotia lubrica) can be confused with young Trumpet Chanterelles. Its fruit bodies consist of a yellow, somewhat slimy stem with a greyer, rather globular head on top, and the whole fruit body has a rubbery consistency.

Chunk 282:
Chunk 5: Although Jellybaby is not poisonous, it has no value as an edible fungus. It often grows with beech trees, so collectors of Trumpet Chanterelles in deciduous woods may also find Jellybaby among them.

Chunk 283:
Chunk 6: While chanterelles belong to the group of basidiomycetes, Jellybaby belongs to the Ascomycota group of fungi. The brown chanterelles are thin-fleshed, have a hollow stem, and exhibit brownish cap colors.

Chunk 284:
Chunk 7: The underside of brown chanterelles is covered by shallow, branched wrinkles or veins. Brown chanterelles are excellent edible mushrooms that can often be found in abundance, making them suitable for pies or pizzas.

Chunk 285:
Chunk 8: Due to their thin flesh, brown chanterelles are also very suitable for drying. Trumpet Chanterelle (Craterellus tubaeformis) has well-developed veins underneath the cap and is found in poor soil with mycorrhiza-forming trees.

Chunk 286:
Chunk 9: Trumpet Chanterelle can grow in large quantities in young spruce plantations and beech woods. It typically fruits from September to November and can be found where nutrient-rich soil is covered by a thin, acidic, poorly decomposed humus layer.

Chunk 287:
Chunk 10: The Horn of Plenty (Craterellus cornucopioides) is an excellent edible mushroom with a strong taste and good consistency. Its hollow, funnel-shaped, black fruit bodies vary in size from a few centimeters up to 15 centimeters tall in old specimens.

Chunk 288:
Chunk 11: Horn of Plenty prefers nutrient-rich, clay soil and forms mycorrhizal associations with beech. It is commonly found in old beech forests, often alongside Trumpet Chanterelle and Pale Chanterelle (Cantharellus pallens).

Chunk 289:
Chunk 12: The Blackening Brittlegill (Russula nigricans) forms large fruit bodies with stem, cap, and gills that are initially grey-brown. Over time, these fruit bodies do not rot like other soft-fleshed fungi but become mummified into black â€˜corpsesâ€™ that remain in the forest.

Chunk 290:
Chunk 13: In its mummified state, the Blackening Brittlegill can be confused with Horn of Plenty. This species forms mycorrhizal associations with beech and grows in the same locations as Horn of Plenty, but it is inedible.

Chunk 291:
Chunk 14: The Crab Brittlegill (Russula xerampelina) is considered one of the best edible species among the brittlegills. It is characterized by a red cap and stem that turns brown after bruising, with pale yellow gills.

Chunk 292:
Chunk 15: The taste of Crab Brittlegill is mild, and as the fruit bodies age, they acquire a strong seafood odor. This species most often grows with pine trees and can also be found with spruce and fir.

Chunk 293:
Chunk 16: Crab Brittlegill prefers light soils that are either acidic or calcareous and can be found scattered in conifer plantations during September and October. Young Crab Brittlegills are very delicious when fried or stewed with cream.

Chunk 294:
Chunk 17: Brittlegills are mushrooms characterized by crisp flesh that largely lacks longitudinal fibers. They do not have a veil and therefore never possess a ring on the stem, and they have white or yellowish spores.

Chunk 295:
Chunk 18: Brittlegills form mycorrhizal associations with trees, and no European species are known to be poisonous, although many can taste hot. The group includes almost 200 species in the UK, which can be difficult to differentiate.

Chunk 296:
Chunk 19: The Sickener (Russula emetica) is one of the most common very hot brittlegills, typically growing in coniferous forests. It can be recognized by its bright red cap, which contrasts with its pure white stem and gills.

Chunk 297:
Chunk 1: The Sickener is a mushroom that is not truly poisonous but is completely inedible due to its unpleasant taste, which is more accurately described as a pain. It is important to avoid rubbing one's eyes after handling this mushroom.

Chunk 298:
Chunk 2: The Beechwood Sickener (Russula mariei) is another inedible mushroom that is commonly found in beech woods.

Chunk 299:
Chunk 3: The Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria) is a similar fungus that features fibrous stem flesh and a partial veil that leaves a ring around the stem. Young Fly Agaric mushrooms are wrapped in a white universal veil, which eventually becomes white scales on the cap.

Chunk 300:
Chunk 4: Brittlegills do not have veils, but it is important to note that remnants of the veil on mushrooms can be washed away by rain, resulting in a smooth and red cap.

Chunk 301:
Chunk 5: Among the red brittlegills, some species are mild and harmless, while others are hot and inedible. The Sickener is the most common hot species found in coniferous forests.

Chunk 302:
Chunk 6: The Crab Brittlegill is an excellent edible mushroom among the mild-tasting, bright red brittlegills. Another edible option is the Hintapink, which can be collected in large quantities during summer.

Chunk 303:
Chunk 7: Hintapink (Russula paludosa) is a large edible red brittlegill characterized by its whitish to cream gills, white stem with red flushes, and shiny orange-red to red cap.

Chunk 304:
Chunk 8: Hintapink has a mild taste when cooked, although it may taste slightly hot when raw. This mushroom grows with spruce and pine on poor soil and is common in Scotland, but rare elsewhere in Britain and Ireland.

Chunk 305:
Chunk 9: Hintapink typically fruits from July to October and is considered a good edible mushroom.

Chunk 306:
Chunk 10: The Fragile Brittlegill (Russula fragilis) is another brittlegill that has a strong taste, easily recognized by its finely serrated gill edge and habitat on poor soils with oak.

Chunk 307:
Chunk 11: The Darkening Brittlegill (Russula vinosa) is a large brittlegill with a shiny, greyish wine-colored cap, cream gills, and a white stem that turns grey with age. It has a mild taste and is edible.

Chunk 308:
Chunk 12: Darkening Brittlegill is found in old coniferous forests and plantations in Scotland, but it is not known to grow elsewhere in Britain and Ireland.

Chunk 309:
Chunk 13: The Copper Brittlegill also turns grey with age but has a more orange cap compared to the Darkening Brittlegill.

Chunk 310:
Chunk 14: Olive Brittlegill (Russula olivacea) is a very large brittlegill with a dull, wine-colored cap that may have olive green shades. Its gills turn yellow with age, and it has a mild taste, making it an acceptable edible mushroom.

Chunk 311:
Chunk 15: Olive Brittlegill is typically found in beech forests, prefers clay soils, and is common in southern regions. It is important to fry Olive Brittlegills thoroughly, as raw specimens may cause stomach upset in some individuals.

Chunk 312:
Chunk 16: The Flirt (Russula vesca), also known as Bare-toothed Brittlegill, is a well-tasting brittlegill that features a pale greyish-red cap and mild taste, with white stem and gills.

Chunk 313:
Chunk 17: The cap cuticle of The Flirt does not fully reach the edge, causing older specimens to appear as though they have "teeth" along the cap margin.

Chunk 314:
Chunk 18: The Flirt is very common in late summer and autumn in beech woods and can also grow with other deciduous trees and conifers.

Chunk 315:
Chunk 19: Ochre Brittlegill (Russula ochroleuca) is a medium-sized brittlegill with a dull yellow cap, whitish gills, and a stem that turns grey with age. It has a somewhat hot taste and is not considered an edible mushroom.

Chunk 316:
Chunk 20: Geranium Brittlegill (Russula fellea) is a small brittlegill with pale brownish-yellow fruitbodies. Its taste is burning hot, rendering it inedible, and it primarily grows in beech woods.

Chunk 317:
Chunk 21: The Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) is a deadly poisonous mushroom that has a yellow form resembling yellow brittlegills. It is identified by its fibrous stem flesh, volva at the base, and partial veil.

Chunk 318:
Chunk 22: Copper Brittlegill (Russula decolorans) is a large, orange brittlegill that grows with pine on sandy soil. Its gills are cream-colored, and the stem is white, turning grey with age.

Chunk 319:
Chunk 23: The Yellow Swamp Brittlegill (Russula claroflava) is a large, bright yellow brittlegill with cream-colored gills. Like Copper Brittlegill, it has a mild taste and turns grey with age.

Chunk 320:
Chunk 24: Yellow Swamp Brittlegill grows on peat soil with birch and is widespread in Britain and Ireland, fruiting from late summer to early autumn.

Chunk 321:
Chunk 25: The Charcoal Burner is a brittlegill with soft and greasy gills that do not break when rubbed. It grows with beech and is widespread.

Chunk 322:
Chunk 26: Greencracked Brittlegill (Russula virescens) is a firm, hard-fleshed brittlegill with a grey-green cap that breaks into a chequered pattern upon expansion.

Chunk 323:
Chunk 1: The stem and gills of the Greencracked Brittlegill mushroom are white, and its taste is mild. This species is often found scattered in southerly, warm beech woods on clay soils. It can form fruitbodies under very dry conditions and is typically found as early as August. Greencracked Brittlegill is considered a good edible fungus.

Chunk 324:
Chunk 2: The Charcoal Burner (Russula cyanoxantha) mushroom can exhibit many colors, with the cap most often dominated by light green. It also features areas with grey and lilac tones, while its stem and gills are white.

Chunk 325:
Chunk 3: The Green Brittlegill (Russula aeruginea) has delicate, grass-green caps, whitish gills, and a white stem. It tastes mild and is regarded as a good edible mushroom. This species always grows in association with birch trees and prefers slightly poor soils found in lawns, parks, and along roadsides. Green Brittlegill is widespread and common from August to October.

Chunk 326:
Chunk 4: Among the green brittlegills, there are several good edible mushrooms. Many of these mushrooms can be difficult to identify to species, but all completely green, mild-tasting brittlegills are considered edible. It is important to note that brittlegills do not have a veil, either around the young fruitbody or covering the gills, and they never display a volva or a ring.

Chunk 327:
Chunk 5: The Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) is a deadly poisonous mushroom that may resemble green brittlegills. When young, the Deathcap is completely wrapped in a veil, which later becomes a volva at the base. It also possesses a partial veil that covers the young gills, often leaving fragments hanging from the margin of the cap or forming a ring around the stem.

Chunk 328:
Chunk 6: Green-capped species of Roundhead (Stropharia) fungi have a ring on the stem and their gills become grey-black due to maturing spores. These mushrooms are not poisonous.

Chunk 329:
Chunk 7: Milkcaps form mycorrhizal associations with trees, which makes them primarily found in woods, forests, and parkland with both coniferous and deciduous trees. In mountainous areas, milkcaps can also be found in low scrub of willow and mountain avens. Most mild-tasting milkcaps can be eaten if species with water-clear milk are avoided.

Chunk 330:
Chunk 8: The only other gilled mushrooms that secrete milky juice are some species of Bonnet (Mycena). Bonnets form small, thin-stemmed fruitbodies and are unlikely to be confused with milkcaps. None of the bonnets with milk are poisonous.

Chunk 331:
Chunk 9: Milkcaps can be categorized into several groups based on the color of their milk: brown milkcaps with white milk, milkcaps with orange milk, milkcaps with water-clear milk, and milkcaps with a hot taste.

Chunk 332:
Chunk 10: The color of the milk is a crucial characteristic for identifying milkcaps, so old, dried-out fruitbodies without milk should be avoided. While there are no dangerously poisonous fungi among the milkcaps, many species can taste hot and are inedible. The Fenugreek Milkcap (Lactarius helvus), which has water-clear milk, may cause stomach upsets.

Chunk 333:
Chunk 11: Milkcaps are essentially brittlegills with a milk-like juice, which is most easily observed by cutting the gills with a knife. The flesh of milkcaps is crisp and lacks longitudinal fibers. They often form large, fleshy fruitbodies with more or less decurrent gills, and the milk can be white, purple, pink, yellow, or clear.

Chunk 334:
Chunk 12: The Oakbug Milkcap (Lactarius quietus) is one of the most common milkcaps, characterized by its dull, grey-brown cap with concentric darker zones and copious white milk. Its taste is mild, but the smell is somewhat unpleasantly spicy, making it not regarded as edible.

Chunk 335:
Chunk 13: The Fishy Milkcap (Lactifluus volemus) forms very compact fruitbodies with a characteristic dull, orange-brown color on the cap and stem. When cut, the gills secrete an abundance of white milk that turns brown upon drying. Although the taste is mild, it often has a slightly bitter aftertaste and smells like shellfish.

Chunk 336:
Chunk 14: The Birch Milkcap (Lactarius tabidus) is one of many small, brown milkcaps with mild, white milk. None of these brown milkcaps are considered good edible mushrooms, but they are all harmless. This species typically grows on moist soil with birch and conifers, such as in bogs.

Chunk 337:
Chunk 15: The Rufous Milkcap (Lactarius rufus) is a medium-sized, reddish-brown milkcap with a pointed peak in the cap's center. It has white milk and is commonly found in coniferous forests. Due to its very hot taste, it is considered inedible.

Chunk 338:
Chunk 16: The False Saffron Milkcap (Lactarius deterrimus) produces orange fruitbodies with sparse orange milk. Its smooth stem lacks the pitted surface found on the Saffron Milkcap. As it ages and after bruising, parts of the cap may turn green. False Saffron Milkcap grows in association with spruce and is more common than the Saffron Milkcap.

Chunk 339:
Chunk 17: The Saffron Milkcap (Lactarius deliciosus) is the best edible fungus among the orange-milked milkcaps. It forms very firm, pale orange fruitbodies with stems that are pitted with small, darker cavities where juice has gathered and dried. The flesh may slowly turn somewhat green after bruising, and it has a mild taste.

Chunk 340:
Chunk 18: Milkcaps with a very hot taste are not considered poisonous, but they are not regarded as edible for obvious reasons.

Chunk 341:
Chunk 1: In some species of mushrooms, the hot taste can be removed through salting. Ugly Milkcap (Lactarius necator) is a large, very hot-tasting milkcap that grows on nutrient-poor soil with birch and conifers. Its cap is predominantly brownish-green, and it has white milk. Ugly Milkcap is completely inedible because of its taste.

Chunk 342:
Chunk 2: The super-hot Rufous Milkcap is also inedible due to its intense flavor. The species in the bearded milkcap group have whitish to pinkish caps with a fringing â€˜beardâ€™ at the cap margin. Their milk is white and very hot. These species are usually not considered edible, although it is possible to remove the hot taste by salting the mushrooms.

Chunk 343:
Chunk 3: Salted milkcaps are popular in Eastern Europe, and after cooking, they develop a strong, slightly meat-like taste. The two most common species in this group are the pale pink Woolly Milkcap (Lactarius torminosus) and the paler Bearded Milkcap (Lactarius pubescens). Both species grow with birch and are widespread and very common throughout autumn.

Chunk 344:
Chunk 4: Fenugreek Milkcap (Lactarius helvus) is the only milkcap that is considered poisonous. It forms large fruitbodies with a dry, somewhat scaly cap surface and brownish colors. The milk of Fenugreek Milkcap is unique in being clear as water. It has a mild taste and a smell reminiscent of curry or stock cubes.

Chunk 345:
Chunk 5: Fenugreek Milkcap grows with deciduous and coniferous trees on poor, moist soils. It can be used sparingly as a spice for soups; however, eating it in larger quantities can result in a stomach upset.

Chunk 346:
Chunk 6: Velvet Shank (Flammulina velutipes) is a common winter fungus characterized by small fruitbodies with a brownish-orange and very slimy cap and whitish gills. The stem has a pale top that gradually becomes dark with a velvety surface below. Velvet Shank is found on various deciduous trees from November to March.

Chunk 347:
Chunk 7: There are several very similar species in the Velvet Shank genus, but all are edible. Velvet Shank is not among the best edible mushrooms due to its slimy cap and mild taste. However, it is commonly found during a time of year when there are not many other mushrooms available.

Chunk 348:
Chunk 8: Enokitake mushrooms, which are sold in supermarkets, are shanks that are grown in the dark. The agarics form a cap with gills beneath, and the cap is usually borne on top of a stem. Unlike brittlegills and milkcaps, the stem flesh of agarics is structured with longitudinal fibers.

Chunk 349:
Chunk 9: The agarics are one of the largest fungal groups and can vary significantly in appearance, ranging from a few millimeters to over half a meter in diameter. The spore color is an important identification feature, and agarics are divided into white-spored, pink-spored, black-spored, and brown-spored species.

Chunk 350:
Chunk 10: The safest method for identifying spore color is to make a spore deposit. Observing the gills of both young and old fruitbodies can also provide valuable information. If the gills change color with age, they are likely colored by the maturing spores.

Chunk 351:
Chunk 11: The white-spored agarics are the most difficult group to recognize because white spores do not effectively mask other colors. Agarics with whitish spores are divided into categories based on gill attachment: free gills, decurrent gills, and adnexed to emarginate gills.

Chunk 352:
Chunk 12: Among the white-spored agarics, there are both delicious and dangerously poisonous species. Poisonous amanitas are responsible for the majority of serious fungal poisonings. It is important to be aware of these when foraging for mushrooms.

Chunk 353:
Chunk 13: Olive Oysterling (Sarcomyxa serotina) has yellowish colors on its gills and stem, and the gills end abruptly instead of running far down the stem. Olive Oysterling is not poisonous. Angelâ€™s Wings (Pleurocybella porrigens) is white on the cap, stem, and gills, but it is poisonous.

Chunk 354:
Chunk 14: There are several similar species with smaller, thin-fleshed fruitbodies, white gills, and oblique stems that grow on wood. Only a few of these are winter fungi, and none are poisonous. Angelâ€™s Wings resemble slender, thin-fleshed, white Oyster Mushrooms and primarily grow on conifers.

Chunk 355:
Chunk 15: If eaten in large quantities, Angelâ€™s Wings are reported to cause severe poisoning. This species is mostly found in Scotland, and caution should be taken to avoid completely white â€˜Oyster Mushroomsâ€™ to mitigate the risk.

Chunk 356:
Chunk 16: Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) grows on deciduous wood, forming large clusters of oblique, greyish-brown to greyish-blue caps. The stem is short and situated at the edge of the cap, not in the middle as is typical in agarics. The underside of the cap is lined with white gills that continue far down the stem.

Chunk 357:
Chunk 17: In young fruitbodies, the gills of Oyster Mushroom often branch to form a coarse net down the stem. These fruitbodies are thick-fleshed with a mild taste and no notable smell. Oyster Mushroom is mostly found from late October to March and prefers deciduous trees like beech, willow, and poplar.

Chunk 358:
Chunk 18: Certain species of Pinkgill (Entoloma) are poisonous. Some species are small and slender, while others are large and fleshy, which can lead to confusion with edible mushrooms. Pinkgills have more distant gills compared to St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom, and the gills become colored by pink spores as they age.

Chunk 359:
Chunk 19: Pinkgills can be found in both wooded habitats and open land.

Chunk 360:
Chunk 1: St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom (Calocybe gambosa) is often found half-hidden in spring vegetation. This mushroom grows in lawns and in deciduous and coniferous forests on well-mixed, humus-rich soils. It typically forms large fairy rings and fruits from April to June.

Chunk 361:
Chunk 2: St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom has medium-sized fruitbodies that are usually white or cream-coloured, although the caps may turn light brown when very wet. The gills of this mushroom are noticeably crowded together and turn pink with age due to their pinkish spores.

Chunk 362:
Chunk 3: The entire fruitbody of St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom has a farinaceous, or flour-like, taste and smell. While described as â€˜flour-likeâ€™, the smell is more reminiscent of cucumber or watermelon rather than modern, refined, white flour.

Chunk 363:
Chunk 4: A similar odour to that of St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom can be found in Dryadâ€™s Saddle. To truly understand the smell of this farinaceous fungus, one must experience it firsthand.

Chunk 364:
Chunk 5: For safetyâ€™s sake, when consuming St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom, it is advised to start with a small portion, use only young specimens, and fry them well to eliminate their strong smell of bitter almonds.

Chunk 365:
Chunk 6: Other similar fungi to St Georgeâ€™s Mushroom include small, white funnels (Clitocybe) that can be very poisonous, as well as funnel-shaped brittlegills and milkcaps (Russula and Lactarius), which have brittle flesh and may be very hot.

Chunk 366:
Chunk 7: Rollrims (Paxillus) have brown colours and their gills become dark brown when bruised. These mushrooms are poisonous and form mycorrhizal associations, growing close to appropriate trees.

Chunk 367:
Chunk 8: Fairy rings formed by fungi appear unusually green and lush due to nutrients released by the fungus. These zones can be visible even in the absence of fruitbodies and are easily seen in aerial photographs.

Chunk 368:
Chunk 9: Giant Funnel (Aspropaxillus giganteus) can cause stomach problems in some individuals, but for most people, it is considered a fine edible fungus. This species grows in woods, gardens, and open habitats.

Chunk 369:
Chunk 10: Giant Funnel is a parasite that kills and decomposes herbs and grasses. When it grows in fields, it may form large, conspicuous fairy rings, creating a 40â€“50 cm-wide zone where the vegetation has been killed.

Chunk 370:
Chunk 11: Giant Funnel has huge fruitbodies with a somewhat funnel-shaped, whitish cap, decurrent gills, and a short fibrous, white stem. The caps can exceed 30 cm in width and the stem thickness ranges from 1 to 5 cm.

Chunk 371:
Chunk 12: Dark Honey Fungus (Armillaria ostoyae) has a robust ring and dark scales on the cap. This species primarily grows on coniferous wood and fruits in late autumn, but may be more difficult to digest than other honey fungus species.

Chunk 372:
Chunk 13: Bulbous Honey Fungus (Armillaria lutea) features a fluffy, cottonwool-like ring and young specimens typically have yellowish scales on the cap, ring, or stem. This species is common on the wood and roots of deciduous trees and is found late in autumn.

Chunk 373:
Chunk 14: Shaggy Scalycap (Pholiota squarrosa) may be confused with honey fungus due to its brown colours and pointed scales. However, its young gills are pale yellow and darken with age, while honey fungi have whitish gills.

Chunk 374:
Chunk 15: Honey fungi are generally considered edible but may cause stomach pain and vomiting if eaten raw. They are known to be good culinary mushrooms in some countries, although some reports indicate they can cause stomach problems.

Chunk 375:
Chunk 16: Honey fungi should be consumed when they are very young, with almost closed caps. It is essential to fry them thoroughly and start with a small portion to ensure they are well-tolerated.

Chunk 376:
Chunk 17: Honey Fungus (Armillaria) is a genus of brownish, white-spored fungi that are parasites on trees. They have medium-sized caps with small honey-yellow to brown scales and white gills that darken with age.

Chunk 377:
Chunk 18: Garlic Parachute (Mycetinis alliaceus) has a strong garlic smell and grows on wood in beech forests. It resembles the Fairy Ring Champignon in cap size and colour, but has a long, felted, dark brown stem.

Chunk 378:
Chunk 19: Garlic Parachute grows on twigs and stems on the woodland floor and is commonly found in old, southern beech woods from August to October. Although it is not a typical edible mushroom, it can be used as a spice for a garlic flavour.

Chunk 379:
Chunk 1: Fairy Ring Champignon (Marasmius oreades) forms fairy rings characterized by numerous small, beige-colored fruitbodies. These mushrooms have adnexed, distant gills and emit a distinctive smell of bitter almonds.

Chunk 380:
Chunk 2: Many small fungi can be found in lawns and fields, but none exhibit the combination of pale brown color, distant gills, and the smell of bitter almonds that Fairy Ring Champignon does. This species is one of the most common in lawns and is often visible due to its fairy rings, which show a zone of dead grass.

Chunk 381:
Chunk 3: Fairy Ring Champignon is considered a reasonable, albeit small, edible mushroom; however, it must be thoroughly fried before consumption.

Chunk 382:
Chunk 4: Brown Parasol (Chlorophyllum brunneum) closely resembles a small species of Macrolepiota but features a smooth stem that does not crack into a snakeskin pattern and has a simple ring. This mushroom typically grows in gardens and greenhouses and may cause upset stomachs in some individuals.

Chunk 383:
Chunk 5: There are several other similar species within the genus Chlorophyllum that are edible. These edible species, like the Giant Parasol, have a double, loose ring at the stem.

Chunk 384:
Chunk 6: Panthercap (Amanita pantherina) can also resemble a parasol mushroom but is smaller and has a non-cracked cap covered with scales, which are the white, loose remnants of the universal veil. This mushroom features a single, hanging ring that is firmly attached around the white stem.

Chunk 385:
Chunk 7: Panthercap forms mycorrhizal associations with trees, which means it will not grow in open landscapes. In contrast, the Giant Parasol is often found in such areas. Panthercap contains neurotoxins that can lead to severe, though not fatal, poisonings.

Chunk 386:
Chunk 8: Giant Parasol (Macrolepiota procera) produces very large fruitbodies with scaly caps that can reach up to 30 cm wide. The cap starts smooth when young but cracks into large scales as it unfolds, leaving a central area that remains whole and brown.

Chunk 387:
Chunk 9: The gills of Giant Parasol are white and free, with young gills covered by a membranous veil that later forms a characteristic double ring that can be moved up and down the stem without breaking.

Chunk 388:
Chunk 10: The stem of Giant Parasol exhibits a dark and white snakeskin pattern. This mushroom grows in woods, fields, and dunes, and is particularly common in coastal areas, especially in the southern parts of Britain. It fruits in late summer and early autumn.

Chunk 389:
Chunk 11: Deathcap (Amanita phalloides) is a deadly poisonous mushroom. Just one fruitbody can cause liver failure and potentially kill an adult, making it responsible for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings in western Europe.

Chunk 390:
Chunk 12: Deathcap forms medium-sized, attractive fruitbodies with a pale green, yellowish, or pale grey cap. Its gills are white and free, producing white spores. The stem has a somewhat cracked surface and often shows remnants of the partial veil as a hanging ring.

Chunk 391:
Chunk 13: In some mature fruitbodies of Deathcap, the ring can be confusingly absent, with the veil remaining only as fragments hanging from the cap margin. At the base of the stem, a bulb can be seen, surrounded by the remnants of the universal veil, known as the volva.

Chunk 392:
Chunk 14: The toxins in Deathcap begin to affect the body long after consumption, making it too late for stomach pumping. Treatment involves activated charcoal and strong antibiotics, but there are no effective antidotes. The toxins specifically target liver cells, leading to potential liver failure and death.

Chunk 393:
Chunk 15: Amanitas form mycorrhizal associations with trees and are typically found near suitable tree species in woods, gardens, and parks. While many amanitas are poisonous, some species are edible. The poisonous varieties contain a range of toxins, with amatoxins being the most dangerous, as found in Deathcap.

Chunk 394:
Chunk 16: It is essential for any guide on edible fungi to include warnings about the most poisonous amanitas. Familiarity with Deathcap, Destroying Angel, and Fly Agaric can significantly enhance safety when identifying edible species.

Chunk 395:
Chunk 17: Amanitas are identifiable by their white, adnexed or free gills and the membranous universal veil that surrounds young fruitbodies. This veil protects the young fruitbody from insect infestation and dehydration.

Chunk 396:
Chunk 18: As the fruitbody matures, the universal veil bursts and remains as either a volva at the base of the stem or as white scales on the cap surface. The partial veil may remain as a ring around the stem or as fragments hanging from the cap margin.

Chunk 397:
Chunk 19: Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria) produces large fruitbodies with red or orange caps. The universal veil typically leaves characteristic white, loose scales on the cap, although rain can wash these away, resulting in a naked appearance.

Chunk 398:
Chunk 20: The gills of Fly Agaric are white and free or rarely adnexed, while the stem is white and features a large, prominent ring. Unlike some amanitas, Fly Agaric does not have a volva at the base.

Chunk 399:
Chunk 21: Fly Agaric forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees, particularly birch and spruce, thriving in nutrient-poor soil. It is commonly found throughout Britain and Ireland, fruiting from September to November.

Chunk 400:
Chunk 22: Fly Agaric is considered poisonous but is not deadly. It contains a mixture of various toxins, excluding the highly dangerous amatoxins found in Deathcap and Destroying Angel.

Chunk 401:
Chunk 1: The Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa) can be confused with white species of Agaricus. The gills of the Destroying Angel remain white throughout their lives, while the gills of Agaricus species turn light grey or pink and later change to dark chocolate-brown as they mature.

Chunk 402:
Chunk 2: The False Deathcap (Amanita citrina) is similar to the Destroying Angel but has a more symmetrical, rounded cap and a smell reminiscent of raw potato. Although this species is not poisonous, it is difficult to identify and should not be considered safe to eat.

Chunk 403:
Chunk 3: The Destroying Angel forms medium-sized, slender, white fruitbodies with white spores. Its cap is high and usually asymmetrical, with free gills and a long, somewhat frayed stem. The partial veil often remains on the stem as a hanging ring, and the base has a bulb surrounded by a white volva, which is the remnant of the universal veil.

Chunk 404:
Chunk 4: The Destroying Angel typically grows in poorer soil and forms mycorrhizal associations with trees such as beech, oak, spruce, and pine. It contains the same toxins as the Deathcap, making it equally poisonous. The Deathcap is responsible for more fatalities due to its higher prevalence in urban areas.

Chunk 405:
Chunk 5: The Wood Blewit (Lepista nuda) has crowded, pale lilac gills and forms medium-sized fruitbodies with violet or purple colors on the gills and/or stem. The fruitbodies are naked, lacking any traces of veil or ring, and emit a characteristic sweetish odor.

Chunk 406:
Chunk 6: The Wood Blewit is a decomposer found in both woodlands and open habitats, often forming large fairy rings. Although all blewits are edible, some people may not favor their perfumed taste and smell. They are generally considered safe to eat.

Chunk 407:
Chunk 7: The Field Blewit (Lepista saeva) resembles a large, pale, grey-brown version of the Wood Blewit, with only the stem showing a lilac shade. This species is salt-tolerant and is commonly found in coastal pastures, as well as roadsides affected by winter salting. It fruits in October and November and is regarded as a good edible fungus.

Chunk 408:
Chunk 8: The Wood Blewit features a violet stem and a smooth, greasy cap surface, with a thickness of 5â€“20 mm and a fine, fluffy pattern. It prefers woodland habitats with deep organic material and is especially common in coniferous forests with thick needle cover. It typically appears in October and is considered a good edible fungus.

Chunk 409:
Chunk 9: The genus Agaricus includes about 40 species in the UK, many of which are difficult to differentiate. These fungi typically decompose organic matter in soil or manure and can be found in both woodlands and open countryside. Many species of Agaricus form fairy rings that may fragment over time.

Chunk 410:
Chunk 10: Members of the genus Agaricus have fleshy fruitbodies with dark chocolate-brown spores and free gills. They possess a partial veil that covers the young gills and later hangs as a ring around the stem. Unlike the Destroying Angel, Agaricus species do not have a volva at the base of the stem.

Chunk 411:
Chunk 11: The Field Mushroom (Agaricus campestris) forms small to medium-sized fruitbodies with a white cap, pink to chocolate-brown gills, and a fragile stem ring. The flesh blushes slowly when cut and has a faint mushroom smell. Field Mushrooms are common in lawns, parks, and grasslands, often forming fairy rings.

Chunk 412:
Chunk 12: The Scaly Wood Mushroom (Agaricus langei) is a medium-sized, brown-capped fungus that reddens immediately when bruised. It has brown gills and a well-developed ring with a cogwheel-like underside. This mushroom has a pleasant smell and is considered a fine edible fungus.

Chunk 413:
Chunk 13: Some poisonous species of Amanita resemble the Field Mushroom but have white gills. Additionally, the reddening species of Parasol (Chlorophyllum) also feature white gills, making identification important for safety.

Chunk 414:
Chunk 1: Scaly Wood Mushroom grows in both deciduous woods and coniferous forests and fruits during autumn. There are several similar species, all of which are edible.

Chunk 415:
Chunk 2: Yellow Stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus) forms medium-sized fruitbodies with a slightly angular cap. It can be chalk-white or greyish and has a well-developed ring with a coarse-toothed cogwheel beneath.

Chunk 416:
Chunk 3: If you scratch a young and fresh Yellow Stainer fruitbody at the cap margin, it immediately turns bright yellow. This reaction is usually also seen in the flesh of the stem base.

Chunk 417:
Chunk 4: If the Yellow Stainer fungus is dry, you should moisten your finger with saliva before rubbing it. The smell of the Yellow Stainer is unpleasant and chemical, resembling phenol, and this odor intensifies when the fruitbodies are cooked in a hot pan.

Chunk 418:
Chunk 5: Some people can eat the Yellow Stainer without any problems, but in most individuals, it causes a stomach upset. Therefore, it should be avoided.

Chunk 419:
Chunk 6: Yellow Stainers are mostly found in parks and cemeteries, where they may be quite common during summer and autumn.

Chunk 420:
Chunk 7: Horse Mushroom (Agaricus arvensis) mostly grows in lawns and fields and fruits from early summer to autumn. There are several closely related species with the same culinary properties.

Chunk 421:
Chunk 8: The more long-stemmed Wood Mushroom (Agaricus silvicola) prefers to grow in woods and forests, while the brown-capped Prince (Agaricus augustus) is found in parks, gardens, and open woodland. All of these species are excellent edible fungi.

Chunk 422:
Chunk 9: Royals are Agaricus species with strong marzipan-like smells and which slowly turn yellow when bruised. Royals are all excellent edible mushrooms.

Chunk 423:
Chunk 10: Unfortunately, Royals have the ability to concentrate the heavy metal cadmium, so they should not be eaten in very large quantities. One should also avoid fruitbodies from potentially contaminated places, such as roadsides in towns and cities.

Chunk 424:
Chunk 11: The Destroying Angel is a deadly poisonous fungus that always has white gills.

Chunk 425:
Chunk 12: Yellow Stainer turns deep yellow immediately when scratched at the cap margin and has a chemical smell, which can cause stomach upsets.

Chunk 426:
Chunk 13: Horse Mushroom forms medium to large, white fruitbodies that slowly turn yellow when bruised. You typically do not notice the yellowing reaction upon picking, but after an hour in the basket, pale yellow spots on the cap and stem become evident.

Chunk 427:
Chunk 14: Like all royals, Horse Mushroom has a well-developed ring with a cogwheel-like structure below. When fruitbodies are damaged, they emit a strong, delicious smell of marzipan.

Chunk 428:
Chunk 15: Common Inkcap (Coprinopsis atramentarius) is a fairly large inkcap that resembles the Shaggy Inkcap but is smoother with small, adpressed brown flakes at the top.

Chunk 429:
Chunk 16: Common Inkcap is found on roadsides and in gardens during both spring and autumn. It is edible but contains the substance coprin, which affects the bodyâ€™s ability to break down alcohol.

Chunk 430:
Chunk 17: Consumption of alcohol even several days after eating Common Inkcap can cause very unpleasant reactions, similar to those experienced after treatment with Antabuse. For safety's sake, one should avoid eating it.

Chunk 431:
Chunk 18: Shaggy Inkcap (Coprinus comatus), also known as Lawyerâ€™s Wig, has the largest fruitbodies among inkcaps, growing up to 40 cm tall. The young caps are whitish or light brown and much taller than wide.

Chunk 432:
Chunk 19: As Shaggy Inkcap matures, the surface begins to crack into large, curved scales. The stem is white, hollow, and has a small, loose ring that easily falls off.

Chunk 433:
Chunk 20: The gills of Shaggy Inkcap are white at first but soon become dark as maturing spores develop from the bottom upwards.

Chunk 434:
Chunk 21: Other species of Inkcap with large fruitbodies, such as Common Inkcap, do not have the characteristic white, curved scales. They are not highly poisonous, but Common Inkcap has a strong effect similar to that of Antabuse.

Chunk 435:
Chunk 22: Shaggy Inkcap fruits in September and October and prefers disturbed places like lawns and stubble fields. It is a fine but very soft-fleshed edible mushroom that can add flavor to dishes.

Chunk 436:
Chunk 23: Inkcaps have free gills that dissolve at maturity, dripping away as a black liquid known as â€˜inkâ€™. Many inkcaps have very crowded gills, allowing the fruitbodies to produce a large number of spores.

Chunk 437:
Chunk 24: Slimy Spike (Gomphidius glutinosus) has grey-brown caps with a slimy upper side. The slime is the remnants of a universal veil that protects the young fruitbodies from dehydration and predation by insects.

Chunk 438:
Chunk 25: The gills of Slimy Spike are decurrent and become grey as the black spores mature. The black spores are easily visible as they get caught in the slimy remnants of the veil at the top of the stem.

Chunk 439:
Chunk 26: The flesh of the stem base of Slimy Spike is strikingly yellow. The combination of decurrent gills, black spores, yellow stem base, and slimy cap makes this species unmistakable.

Chunk 440:
Chunk 27: Livid Pinkgill (Entoloma sinuatum) may look similar to Slimy Spike, but it has gills that eventually turn yellow-red due to the pinkish spores and lacks a ring. It grows in nutrient-rich deciduous woodlands and can cause severe stomach upsets and liver failure.

Chunk 441:
Chunk 28: The Gypsy is a very fine edible fungus that forms mycorrhizal associations with deciduous and coniferous trees. However, it is rare in Britain and Ireland, with most records coming from Scotland.

Chunk 442:
Chunk 1: In more mountainous regions of Europe, including the Alps, Norway, and Sweden, The Gypsy mushroom (Cortinarius caperatus) is much more common. There are some very poisonous webcaps, which are much more strongly colored, appearing either dark orange-brown or orange-yellow, and cannot be confused with The Gypsy.

Chunk 443:
Chunk 2: The Gypsy mushroom forms tall, elegant fruit bodies with a pale greyish-yellow cap, greyish-yellow gills, and a whitish stem that is slightly wider at the base. Young caps have small, flaky, pale scales. Around the stem is a characteristic ring that often has a small, protruding ridge from the middle.

Chunk 444:
Chunk 3: The ring on The Gypsy is the remnant of a membranous veil that protects the young gills. The spores of The Gypsy are rusty brown. For many years, this species was placed in its own genus, Rozites, but it has been shown that it belongs among the webcaps (Cortinarius).

Chunk 445:
Chunk 4: Puffballs are a group of fungi that form spherical or pear-shaped fruit bodies, which at maturity become filled with brownish spores. When young, they are solid and uniformly white inside, making them edible at that stage. Puffballs belong to a group called stomach fungi, which develop spores inside the fruit body.

Chunk 446:
Chunk 5: Puffballs rely on external forces, such as raindrops or movement, to release their spores, as they cannot actively disperse them. Young puffballs are edible, but their culinary value is not high. The Common Puffball (Lycoperdon perlatum) grows on the ground in forests, while the Mosaic Puffball (Lycoperdon utriforme) grows in different habitats.

Chunk 447:
Chunk 6: The Giant Puffball (Calvatia gigantea) is an interesting edible fungus that forms huge, spherical fruit bodies, sometimes resembling footballs or larger. When young, the fruit bodies are white inside, but as they age, they fill with billions of brown spores and eventually degrade to look like dusty bath sponges.

Chunk 448:
Chunk 7: Giant Puffballs typically grow in nutrient-rich soil, such as in gardens and well-fertilized fields, and are especially found in the southern parts of Britain. They fruit in August and early September. Smaller puffballs may be confused with young amanitas, but Giant Puffballs are much larger, making confusion unlikely.

Chunk 449:
Chunk 8: Jelly Ear (Auricularia auricula-judae) forms medium-sized, ear-shaped, brown fruit bodies with a soft, cartilaginous consistency. The upper side is covered with small hairs, while the underside is smooth and somewhat wrinkled. Jelly Ear prefers to grow on elder trees but can also be found on many other deciduous trees.

Chunk 450:
Chunk 9: Jelly fungi, including Jelly Ear, are jelly-like or cartilaginous basidiomycetes that mainly grow on wood. Many species of jelly fungi form fruit bodies during the winter months. While there are no poisonous jelly fungi, most species are not considered edible due to their consistency.

Chunk 451:
Chunk 10: In Asian cuisine, two species of jelly fungi are used: the White Jelly Fungus (Tremella fuciformis) and an Asian species of Jelly Ear. Leafy Brain (Phaeotremella foliaccea) is similar to Jelly Ear but has a more jelly-like appearance and is not hairy. Leafy Brain is not considered an edible mushroom.

Chunk 452:
Chunk 11: Tripe Fungus (Auricularia mesenterica) forms protruding, cartilaginous caps with a hairy upper side and yellowish-grey colors. The underside of the caps is usually strongly wrinkled or folded, much more pronounced than in Jelly Ear. Tripe Fungus is not considered edible, but it is not poisonous.

Chunk 453:
Chunk 1: Elm trees are commonly associated with jelly fungi, which can be found predominantly on their bark.
